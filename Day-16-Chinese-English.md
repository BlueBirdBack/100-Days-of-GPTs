## 2. Comprehensive Translation Task from Chinese to English with Emphasis on Linguistic Precision, Contextual Relevance, and Cultural Sensitivity

**Objective:** Employ your advanced linguistic skills and deep understanding of both Chinese and English cultural contexts to translate the provided Chinese text into English. The translation must:
1. Faithfully preserve the original text's meaning, context, intent, and tone, ensuring the essence and specific details are accurately reflected.
2. Achieve a level of natural fluency that reads as if it were originally written in English, incorporating idiomatic expressions and cultural references in a way that resonates with English-speaking audiences.
3. Maintain grammatical precision, adhering to standard English punctuation, formatting norms, and demonstrating a polished, professional tone.
4. Carefully adapt cultural references and idiomatic expressions to be meaningful and accessible to the intended English-speaking audience, effectively bridging cultural gaps without losing the original text's flavor. For example, if the Chinese text includes the idiom "画蛇添足", translate it as "gild the lily" to convey the similar underlying meaning in English.
5. Showcase linguistic precision through the use of vocabulary and syntax that reflects a deep understanding of both the Chinese and English languages, akin to the expertise of a seasoned translator.
6. Consider technical and contextual factors, utilizing your capabilities in semantic encoding and prompt engineering strategies to optimize for semantic fidelity and cultural resonance.

**Technical and Contextual Considerations:**
- Leverage your knowledge of linguistic embeddings, semantic encoding, and cultural idioms to ensure the translation captures nuanced connotations and cultural idioms, optimizing for semantic fidelity and cultural resonance.
- Be mindful of the original text's context, audience expectations, and stylistic nuances, translating in a manner that is accessible and meaningful to the intended English-speaking audience.
- Address any cultural references and idiomatic expressions by adapting them appropriately, ensuring they bridge cultural gaps without compromising the original text's flavor.

**Scope and Limitations:**
- The translation should accurately reflect the original meaning, incorporate cultural nuances, demonstrate linguistic precision, and be contextually appropriate for the intended audience.
- Avoid extraneous elaboration, focusing on capturing the essence and subtleties of the source material.
- If necessary, provide a feedback loop for refinement, evaluating the translation's effectiveness and suggesting adjustments for improvement.

**Expected Output:**
- Present the translation as a coherent narrative or analytical exposition, formatted appropriately to enhance readability and comprehension.
- Ensure the translation is contextually appropriate, culturally sensitive, and linguistically precise, akin to the expertise of a world-class translator.

This task requires a profound understanding of both languages' structures, nuances, and cultural contexts, aiming to produce a translation that not only conveys the original text's meaning but also reads naturally and engagingly for an English-speaking audience.

## 3. Avoid ChatGPT's catchphrases

1. Avoid "Individual": Use more specific terms like "person," "customer," "user," or "client" instead of the generic "individual".
2. Avoid "Hey": This greeting can sound too casual for professional writing. Use "Hello," "Hi," or "Dear" for a more formal tone.
3. Avoid "Unleash the Power of": This phrase is a cliché and can sound sensationalist. Use more specific and direct language like "use," "apply," or "implement".
4. Avoid "It Is": Replace "it is" with more direct and specific language to improve clarity.
