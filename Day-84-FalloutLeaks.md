The Fallout TV series premiered on Amazon Prime Video on April 10, 2024.

## Plot
The series is set in the post-apocalyptic world of the Fallout video games, over 200 years after a nuclear war devastated the Earth in 2077. It follows a young woman named Lucy who leaves the safety of her underground Vault 33 to venture into the dangerous wasteland of what was once Los Angeles to rescue her kidnapped father. Along the way, she encounters various characters including a Brotherhood of Steel soldier named Maximus and a mysterious ghoul bounty hunter known as "The Ghoul".

While set in the same universe as the games, the show tells an original story that is considered canon but not a direct adaptation of any particular Fallout game. The creators wanted to capture the quirky tone, retro-futuristic setting, and mix of humor and violence that the games are known for.

## Cast

The main characters in the Fallout TV series are:

- Lucy MacLean (played by Ella Purnell) - A young woman who leaves the safety of her underground Vault 33 to venture into the dangerous wasteland of what was once Los Angeles to rescue her kidnapped father.
- Maximus (played by Aaron Moten) - A young soldier who serves in the militaristic faction called the Brotherhood of Steel. He believes in their mission to bring order to the wasteland.
- The Ghoul/Cooper Howard (played by Walton Goggins) - A pragmatic and ruthless ghoul bounty hunter who survives in the wasteland and has a mysterious past. Before the war, he was an actor named Cooper Howard.
- Hank MacLean (played by Kyle MacLachlan) - The Overseer of Vault 33, Lucy's father, and a warm presence in her life who gets kidnapped.
- Norm MacLean (played by Mois√©s Arias) - Lucy's brother who stays behind in Vault 33 while she searches for their father.

Other supporting characters include Thaddeus (Johnny Pemberton), Chet (Dave Register), Moldaver (Sarita Choudhury), Dr. Siggi Wilzig (Michael Emerson), Steph (Annabel O'Hagan), and members of the Vault 33 council like Woody (Zach Cherry), Betty (Leslie Uggams), and Reg (Rodrigo Luzzi).

The show follows Lucy, Maximus, and The Ghoul's intersecting storylines as they navigate the dangerous post-apocalyptic wasteland over 200 years after a devastating nuclear war.

## Production
The series was created by Jonathan Nolan and Lisa Joy, the duo behind HBO's Westworld, and their production company Kilter Films. Nolan directed the first three episodes. Bethesda Game Studios, the developer of the Fallout games, is also involved in production, with game director Todd Howard serving as an executive producer to help ensure authenticity to the source material.

Filming took place in 2022 in locations like New Jersey, New York, Utah and Namibia. The show features music composed by Ramin Djawadi (Game of Thrones).

## Release
Originally announced for an April 12, 2024 debut, the release date was moved up to April 10, with all eight episodes of season 1 dropping at once on Prime Video. This is a change from Amazon's usual weekly release strategy for original series.

Early reviews have praised the show's faithfulness to the games, the performances (especially Purnell, Goggins and Moten), the retro-futuristic visuals and production design, and the balance of quirky humor and harsh violence. A second season seems likely given the positive reception so far.
