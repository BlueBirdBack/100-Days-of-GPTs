## How to Use?

### Example 1

***Prompt:** Tag animals in pictures?*

**Vision Coder:** To tag animals in pictures, we can use a vision AI model. Let's write a Python script using GPT-4 Vision, which is capable of analyzing images and generating descriptions or tags for the content of the images. This script will load an image, send it to GPT-4 Vision, and ask the model to identify and tag any animals present in the image.

First, ensure you have the `openai` Python package installed. You can install it using pip:

```sh
pip install openai
```

Next, here's a script that loads an image, encodes it in base64 (since GPT-4 Vision API requires the image to be in base64 format for local images), and sends it to the API with a prompt to tag animals in the picture:

```python
import os
import base64
from openai import OpenAI

# Load your OpenAI API Key from environment variables
API_KEY = os.getenv("OPENAI_API_KEY")
client = OpenAI(api_key=API_KEY)

# Path to your local image
img_path = '/mnt/data/jetpack.jpg'  # Update this path to your image file

# Encode the image in base64
with open(img_path, "rb") as img_file:
    img_base64 = base64.b64encode(img_file.read()).decode("utf-8")

# Construct the prompt asking GPT-4 Vision to tag animals in the picture
prompt = "Identify and tag any animals in this picture."

# Send the image and the prompt to GPT-4 Vision API
response = client.chat.completions.create(
    model="gpt-4-1106-vision-preview",  # Make sure to use the correct model name for vision tasks
    messages=[
        {
            "role": "user",
            "content": [
                {
                    "type": "image_url",
                    "image_url": {"url": f"data:image/jpeg;base64,{img_base64}"},
                },
                {"type": "text", "text": prompt},
            ],
        }
    ]
)

# Print the response from the API
print(response.choices[0].message.content)
```

Please replace `'/mnt/data/jetpack.jpg'` with the path to your actual image file if you're using a different one. This script will send the image to GPT-4 Vision, which will analyze the content and return tags related to any animals detected in the image. The response from the API will be printed out, showing the identified animals and possibly other relevant information based on the content of the image.

1. Online Documentation

When responding to the user's question, I may use the `browser` tool (the "Web Browsing" capability) to access relevant online documentation if needed. Some potentially useful documentation sources include:

2. Code Snippets

The following code snippets share the same core, which is borrowed from the "Use images in your prompt" section of the [Gemini API Cookbook Prompting quickstart notebook on GitHub](https://github.com/google-gemini/gemini-api-cookbook/blob/main/quickstarts/Prompting.ipynb).

The same `prompt` will be reused across the code snippets.

```
prompt = """This image contains a sketch of a potential product along with some notes.
Given the product sketch, describe the product as thoroughly as possible based on what you
see in the image, making sure to note all of the product features. Return output in json format:
{description: description, features: [feature1, feature2, feature3, etc]}"""
```

The following three lines of code are also reused throughout the code snippets:

```
import os
from dotenv import load_dotenv, find_dotenv
load_dotenv(find_dotenv())
```

Ensure that you incorporate the above code into your response script as needed.

## 2.1 GPT-4 Vision

This Python code demonstrates how to use OpenAI's GPT-4 Vision model to analyze an image.

### Use a local image file:

```
import base64
from openai import OpenAI

API_KEY = os.getenv("OPENAI_API_KEY")
client = OpenAI(api_key=API_KEY)

img_path = os.path.join(os.path.dirname(__file__), "jetpack.jpg")
with open(img_path, "rb") as img_file:
    img_base64 = base64.b64encode(img_file.read()).decode("utf-8")

messages = [
    {
        "role": "user",
        "content": [
            {
                "type": "image_url",
                "image_url": {"url": f"data:image/jpeg;base64,{img_base64}"},
            },
            {"type": "text", "text": prompt},
        ],
    }
]

response = client.chat.completions.create(
    model="gpt-4-1106-vision-preview", messages=messages
)
```

### Use an image URL:

- Replace the base64 encoded image data with the direct image URL, such as "https://storage.googleapis.com/generativeai-downloads/images/jetpack.jpg"
- Remove base64 encoding/decoding code

## 2.2 Claude 3

### Use a local image file:

```
import base64
from anthropic import Anthropic

API_KEY = os.getenv("CLAUDE_API_KEY")
client = Anthropic(api_key=API_KEY)

img_path = os.path.join(os.path.dirname(__file__), "jetpack.jpg")
with open(img_path, "rb") as img_file:
    img_base64 = base64.b64encode(img_file.read()).decode("utf-8")

messages = [
    {
        "role": "user",
        "content": [
            {
                "type": "image",
                "source": {
                    "type": "base64",
                    "media_type": "image/jpeg",
                    "data": img_base64,
                },
            },
            {"type": "text", "text": prompt},
        ],
    }
]

response = client.messages.create(
    model="claude-3-haiku-20240307", max_tokens=1024, messages=messages
)

print(response.content[0].text)
```

- Claude 3 Opus: claude-3-opus-20240229
- Claude 3 Sonnet: claude-3-sonnet-20240229
- Claude 3 Haiku: claude-3-haiku-20240307

### Use an image URL:

Add the following code:
```
import httpx

image_url = "https://storage.googleapis.com/generativeai-downloads/images/jetpack.jpg"
img_base64 = base64.b64encode(httpx.get(image_url).content).decode("utf-8")
```

Remove the following code:
```
img_path = os.path.join(os.path.dirname(__file__), "jetpack.jpg")
with open(img_path, "rb") as img_file:
    img_base64 = base64.b64encode(img_file.read()).decode("utf-8")
```

## 2.3 Gemini Pro Vision 1.0

```
import google.generativeai as genai
from PIL import Image

API_KEY = os.getenv("GEMINI_API_KEY")

img_path = os.path.join(os.path.dirname(__file__), "jetpack.jpg")
img = Image.open(img_path)

model = genai.GenerativeModel("gemini-pro-vision")
response = model.generate_content([prompt, img])
print(response.text)
```

## 2.4 Using OpenRouter to Access Multiple AI Models

OpenRouter.ai provides a unified API to access dozens of AI models. To use a specific model, simply update the `model` parameter in your code. Some notable models include:

- GPT-4 Vision: "openai/gpt-4-vision-preview"
- Claude 3 Opus: "anthropic/claude-3-opus"
- Claude 3 Sonnet: "anthropic/claude-3-sonnet"
- Claude 3 Haiku: "anthropic/claude-3-haiku"
- Gemini Pro Vision 1.0: "google/gemini-pro-vision"

```
from os import getenv, path
from dotenv import load_dotenv, find_dotenv
import base64
from openai import OpenAI

load_dotenv(find_dotenv())

client = OpenAI(
    base_url="https://openrouter.ai/api/v1",
    api_key=getenv("OPENROUTER_API_KEY"),
)

img_path = path.join(path.dirname(__file__), "jetpack.jpg")
with open(img_path, "rb") as img_file:
    img_base64 = base64.b64encode(img_file.read()).decode("utf-8")

prompt = """This image contains a sketch of a potential product along with some notes.
Given the product sketch, describe the product as thoroughly as possible based on what you
see in the image, making sure to note all of the product features. Return output in json format:
{description: description, features: [feature1, feature2, feature3, etc]}"""

messages = [
    {
        "role": "user",
        "content": [
            {
                "type": "image_url",
                "image_url": {"url": f"data:image/jpeg;base64,{img_base64}"},
            },
            {"type": "text", "text": prompt},
        ],
    }
]

response = client.chat.completions.create(
    model="openai/gpt-4-vision-preview", messages=messages
)
print(response.choices[0].message.content)
