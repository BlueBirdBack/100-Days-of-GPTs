Well, back when I was in the Marines,

72
00:03:46,958 --> 00:03:50,375
they taught us that
if they ever drop a really big bomb,

73
00:03:50,458 --> 00:03:53,041
told us to hold up your thumb
just like this.

74
00:03:53,125 --> 00:03:56,791
And if the cloud is smaller
than your thumb,

75
00:03:56,875 --> 00:03:58,625
well, you run for the hills.

76
00:03:58,708 --> 00:04:00,708
And if it's bigger than your thumb?

77
00:04:02,458 --> 00:04:04,291
They told us not to bother running.

00:04:08,958 --> 00:04:11,291

00:14:08,458 --> 00:14:11,625
Lee Moldaver, overseer of 32.

180
00:14:13,125 --> 00:14:15,041
Thank you for your hospitality.

181
00:14:15,125 --> 00:14:18,083
Oh, we were sorry to hear
of Overseer Jackson's passing

182
00:14:18,166 --> 00:14:19,500
in your telegrams.

183
00:14:19,583 --> 00:14:22,250
When blight hit our wheat,

184
00:14:22,333 --> 00:14:24,500
we lost a lot of good people,
but this trade

185
00:14:24,583 --> 00:14:26,875
will help us get back on our feet.

186
00:14:26,958 --> 00:14:30,958
Yes, well, as arranged,
we offer you seed and parts

187
00:14:31,041 --> 00:14:34,125
- for machinery.
- In exchange, we offer you a breeder.

188
00:14:34,208 --> 00:14:37,125
So...

189
00:14:37,208 --> 00:14:39,333
who am I marrying?

190
00:14:50,833 --> 00:14:51,833
I'm Lucy.

191
00:14:51,916 --> 00:14:54,500
Do you have a name?

192
00:14:54,583 --> 00:14:55,791
Monty.

193
00:15:01,458 --> 00:15:03,083
Lucky.

So, what's your sperm count?

201
00:15:35,166 --> 00:15:37,041
<i>♪ And whose loving arms...</i>

202
00:15:38,166 --> 00:15:40,083
Uh...

203
00:15:40,166 --> 00:15:43,083
Your vault's doctor
must check every physical, no?

204
00:15:43,166 --> 00:15:45,625
I mean, sperm is pretty important
in perpetuating America.

205
00:15:45,708 --> 00:15:47,416
Stop.

206
00:15:52,625 --> 00:15:56,583
Good evening and welcome
to the proud denizens

207
00:15:56,666 --> 00:15:58,041
of Vault 32.

208
00:16:05,291 --> 00:16:08,833
We are bonded

209
00:16:08,916 --> 00:16:11,166
not just as neighbors

210
00:16:11,250 --> 00:16:13,791
but by a shared duty.

211
00:16:13,875 --> 00:16:16,708
To keep the candle of civilization lit.

212
00:16:17,750 --> 00:16:19,666
While the rest of the world has been cast

213
00:16:19,750 --> 00:16:21,750
into darkness.

214
00:16:22,958 --> 00:16:24,416
Soon,

215
00:16:24,500 --> 00:16:27,250
if our measurements are correct,

216
00:16:27,333 --> 00:16:31,583
radiation levels on the surface
are dropping fast enough

217
00:16:31,666 --> 00:16:35,625
that the next generation,
Lucy and Monty's children,

218
00:16:35,708 --> 00:16:38,083
will be able to recolonize.

219
00:16:40,291 --> 00:16:42,666
Whoo!

220
00:16:42,750 --> 00:16:45,500
Yes.

221
00:16:47,916 --> 00:16:49,666
After 200 years...

222
00:16:50,708 --> 00:16:53,708
...we don't know much
about what's up there.

223
00:16:53,791 --> 00:16:56,791
Desperation, violence,

224
00:16:56,875 --> 00:16:58,750
lawlessness.

225
00:16:58,833 --> 00:17:01,916
These survivors will need to be shown

226
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:03,833
a better way.

227
00:17:03,916 --> 00:17:07,500
I'll admit I'm sometimes afraid

228
00:17:07,583 --> 00:17:11,583
that mean old world
will change us instead.

229
00:17:11,666 --> 00:17:14,166
But then I look at my daughter...

230
00:17:15,833 --> 00:17:18,708
...who's such a beautiful bride,
and her new husband.

231
00:17:18,791 --> 00:17:22,041
And I am not afraid.

232
00:17:22,125 --> 00:17:25,916
I feel hope.

233
00:17:27,250 --> 00:17:28,875
To Lucy MacLean.

234
00:17:28,958 --> 00:17:30,351
And to this marriage.

235
00:17:30,375 --> 00:17:32,125
And to hope.

236
00:17:34,708 --> 00:17:36,958

00:34:26,500 --> 00:34:28,250
How's your nose?

367
00:34:29,958 --> 00:34:32,000
I can still smell, it's just...

368
00:34:32,083 --> 00:34:34,625
mostly blood.

369
00:34:36,333 --> 00:34:38,208
Flesh is weak, but steel endures.

370
00:34:38,291 --> 00:34:40,375
I-I know.

371
00:34:43,583 --> 00:34:45,375
- Come on.
- Yeah.

372
00:34:45,458 --> 00:34:47,833
Uh-huh.

373
00:34:47,916 --> 00:34:49,250

00:35:09,250 --> 00:35:11,291
It is the duty
of the Brotherhood of Steel

379
00:35:11,375 --> 00:35:13,208
to secure the Wasteland.

380
00:35:13,291 --> 00:35:16,083
One day as squires, you will help knights

381
00:35:16,166 --> 00:35:20,083
find and identify prewar tech.

382
00:35:20,166 --> 00:35:23,000
Aspirant Maximus.

383
00:35:27,833 --> 00:35:30,875
Can you identify this relic?

384
00:35:32,625 --> 00:35:34,500
It's a...

385
00:35:34,583 --> 00:35:36,208
...rotor?

386
00:35:37,791 --> 00:35:39,583
A circuit.

387
00:35:39,666 --> 00:35:42,875
The ability to defend yourself
is but one part of your training.

388
00:35:42,958 --> 00:35:48,625
We are the finders and the preservers.

389
00:35:48,708 --> 00:35:51,375
Unless you know what to find and preserve,

390
00:35:51,458 --> 00:35:56,208
you are more useful as a corpse.

391
00:36:39,291 --> 00:36:40,750
Yeah, look at that shit.

392
00:36:46,666 --> 00:36:49,708
- What kind of model is that?
- It's the T-60.

393
00:36:49,791 --> 00:36:52,041
Imagine getting to put on
one of those every day.

394
00:36:59,625 --> 00:37:01,916

Latrine duty's a two-person job.

401
00:37:38,208 --> 00:37:40,625
I said come on.

402
00:37:40,708 --> 00:37:42,750
That hole of shit isn't going anywhere.

403
00:38:42,041 --> 00:38:43,625

411
00:39:43,125 --> 00:39:45,416
A bunch of us were chosen to get anointed.

412
00:39:45,500 --> 00:39:46,958
Hey.

413
00:39:47,041 --> 00:39:49,250
- What's your title gonna be?
- Squire. To Knight Titus.

414
00:39:49,333 --> 00:39:51,250
And get this, we're going to the Wilds.

00:39:51,333 --> 00:39:52,791

I have a proposal for the assembly.

433
00:42:30,333 --> 00:42:33,041
We send a search party
to the surface to find my dad.

434
00:42:33,125 --> 00:42:34,351
To the surface?

435
00:42:34,375 --> 00:42:35,851
We can spare
four people from farm duty

436
00:42:35,875 --> 00:42:37,291
for up to two weeks,

437
00:42:37,375 --> 00:42:38,615
even with our dwindled numbers.

438
00:42:38,666 --> 00:42:41,000
Sorry, Lucy, but you're talking about

439
00:42:41,083 --> 00:42:43,166
opening the outer vault door?

440
00:42:43,250 --> 00:42:44,916
Just for under a minute.

441
00:42:45,000 --> 00:42:46,791
Okay? It's just enough time to...

442
00:42:46,875 --> 00:42:49,250
Okay, I-I know we're just...
we're brainstorming here,

443
00:42:49,333 --> 00:42:51,208
and there's no bad ideas
in a brainstorm...

444
00:42:51,291 --> 00:42:52,809
- Maybe for you.
- ...but that's not something

445
00:42:52,833 --> 00:42:53,916
that we ever do

446
00:42:54,000 --> 00:42:55,875
or have ever done, never, ever, ever.

447
00:42:55,958 --> 00:42:57,041
I-I know, I know that.

448
00:42:57,125 --> 00:43:00,541
I know we're all hurting right now,

449
00:43:00,625 --> 00:43:02,166
but our first priority

450
00:43:02,250 --> 00:43:05,916
has to be to maintain
the security of this vault.

451
00:43:06,000 --> 00:43:08,791
That means not opening any of our doors.

452
00:43:08,875 --> 00:43:09,958
Well said, Betty.

453
00:43:10,041 --> 00:43:11,791
Yes, thank you, Betty.

454
00:43:11,875 --> 00:43:13,083
Okay, let's move on.

455
00:43:13,166 --> 00:43:15,166
They don't want to find Dad.

456
00:43:16,916 --> 00:43:19,375
If they did, they wouldn't
get to be in charge.

457
00:44:16,875 --> 00:44:18,208
Hey, Davey.

458
00:44:18,291 --> 00:44:19,500
- Hey.
- How's your day going?

459
00:44:20,500 --> 00:44:22,458
Bad as everyone else's.

460
00:45:12,750 --> 00:45:13,916
Hold the elevator.

461
00:45:28,291 --> 00:45:29,291
Take care of Norm

462
00:45:29,375 --> 00:45:31,166
till I'm back, okay?

463
00:45:32,708 --> 00:45:34,625
I can't.

464
00:45:34,708 --> 00:45:36,875
I'm going with you.

465
00:45:36,958 --> 00:45:39,041
- Chet...
- What you're doing is insane.

466
00:45:39,125 --> 00:45:40,791
You don't even know which way to go.

467
00:45:40,875 --> 00:45:42,750
It isn't like the vault out there.

468
00:45:42,833 --> 00:45:43,833
It's big.

469
00:45:49,416 --> 00:45:50,833
Chet...

470
00:45:50,916 --> 00:45:52,750
I'm not letting anyone else

471
00:45:52,833 --> 00:45:54,291
get hurt on my behalf.

472
00:45:54,375 --> 00:45:55,916
Okay?

473
00:46:01,291 --> 00:46:02,875
Oh, Lucy.

474
00:46:04,833 --> 00:46:06,958
Oh, okay. There we go.

475
00:46:16,333 --> 00:46:18,875
I just tranq'd him.

476
00:46:18,958 --> 00:46:20,998
And I'll do the same to you
if you try to follow me.

477
00:46:22,291 --> 00:46:23,500
I'm too chicken.

478
00:46:23,583 --> 00:46:24,875
Thanks.

479
00:46:56,166 --> 00:46:57,916
I'm bringing him home.

480
00:47:33,875 --> 00:47:35,083
Stop!

481
00:47:35,166 --> 00:47:36,500
Lucy!

482
00:47:36,583 --> 00:47:38,875
Are you mad?

483
00:47:38,958 --> 00:47:41,666
Young lady, come back here right away!

484
00:47:43,291 --> 00:47:44,791
Lucy!

485
00:47:46,916 --> 00:47:48,750
Lucy, no!

486
00:47:55,541 --> 00:47:57,375
That didn't work.

487
00:49:46,583 --> 00:49:48,833
Okey dokey.

488
00:50:19,125 --> 00:50:22,125
We have given you a name.

489
00:50:25,041 --> 00:50:26,333
Food.

490
00:50:26,416 --> 00:50:28,458
Education.

491
00:50:28,541 --> 00:50:30,500
A place in the world.

492
00:50:30,583 --> 00:50:32,500
So...

493
00:50:33,625 --> 00:50:35,958
...we expect you to give us

494
00:50:36,041 --> 00:50:38,541
the truth.

495
00:50:38,625 --> 00:50:40,708
Why did you join the Brotherhood?

496
00:50:41,916 --> 00:50:44,375
To hurt the people who hurt me.

497
00:50:54,041 --> 00:50:57,291
I understand you're
a friend of Aspirant Dane.

498
00:50:57,375 --> 00:50:59,375
Yes.

499
00:50:59,458 --> 00:51:01,333
You're aware of their injury?

500
00:51:01,416 --> 00:51:02,583
Yes.

501
00:51:02,666 --> 00:51:05,083
Do you know who did it?

502
00:51:07,708 --> 00:51:09,708
No.

503
00:51:13,791 --> 00:51:16,458
Your fellow aspirants say it was you.

504
00:51:19,958 --> 00:51:22,458
No, I...

505
00:51:22,541 --> 00:51:24,291
I-I wouldn't...

506
00:51:24,375 --> 00:51:26,083
Why not?

507
00:51:26,166 --> 00:51:28,166
Your friend was promoted, you were not.

508
00:51:28,250 --> 00:51:30,541
You have ambitions, don't you?

509
00:51:44,625 --> 00:51:45,750
Speak.

510
00:51:45,833 --> 00:51:47,750
I didn't.

511
00:51:47,833 --> 00:51:50,083
I didn't do it. I did not. I...

512
00:51:58,833 --> 00:52:01,875
I wanted it to happen.
Is that wrong?

513
00:52:07,083 --> 00:52:09,250
Yes.

514
00:52:11,041 --> 00:52:13,041
Yes.

515
00:52:13,125 --> 00:52:14,875
Violence...

516
00:52:14,958 --> 00:52:16,708
is merely a tool.

517
00:52:16,791 --> 00:52:20,666
We use it to bring order
to the Wasteland, but

518
00:52:20,750 --> 00:52:25,416
violence against a Brother of Steel

519
00:52:25,500 --> 00:52:27,791
is a sign of weakness.

520
00:52:31,250 --> 00:52:33,291
But are you?

521
00:52:35,500 --> 00:52:37,875
Weak?

522
00:52:41,375 --> 00:52:44,750
I don't want to be. I...

523
00:53:02,916 --> 00:53:04,750
You have anything else to say

524
00:53:04,833 --> 00:53:07,208
in your defense?

525
00:53:19,041 --> 00:53:21,375
I just...

526
00:53:23,000 --> 00:53:25,166
I just...

527
00:53:25,250 --> 00:53:27,625
I-I want to thank you.

528
00:53:35,083 --> 00:53:37,500
For your guidance and...

529
00:53:37,583 --> 00:53:39,416
for giving me a home.

530
00:53:39,500 --> 00:53:42,166
I-I had no place in the world.

531
00:53:42,250 --> 00:53:44,250
So...

532
00:53:47,666 --> 00:53:50,958
...if I can help
the Brotherhood make it better...

533
00:53:53,416 --> 00:53:56,125
...Eden or whatever...

534
00:53:58,541 --> 00:54:01,083
...even if it means giving my own life...

535
00:54:02,416 --> 00:54:04,416
...I'll do it.

536
00:54:12,541 --> 00:54:16,416
And I'd be grateful to the Brotherhood
for giving my life meaning.

537
00:54:20,166 --> 00:54:22,416
Good boy.

538
00:54:25,791 --> 00:54:28,666
Then you will be Knight Titus'

539
00:54:28,750 --> 00:54:30,666
new squire.

540
00:55:01,166 --> 00:55:03,291
It's not so bad.

541
00:55:03,375 --> 00:55:06,416
At least here no one steals your rations.

542
00:55:07,625 --> 00:55:09,705
They said I'll still have
a place at the Brotherhood.

543
00:55:11,166 --> 00:55:13,166
But I heard you got my spot.

544
00:55:19,083 --> 00:55:21,166
You know who did it?

545
00:55:23,000 --> 00:55:25,101
Oh, I've narrowed it down
to any one of those assholes.

546
00:55:26,041 --> 00:55:27,434
- Yeah.
- You like that?

547
00:55:27,458 --> 00:55:28,583
- No!
- There you are.

548
00:55:28,666 --> 00:55:30,958
- Ah! Yeah!
- Stop it!

549
00:55:31,041 --> 00:55:32,375
He likes it.

550
00:55:32,458 --> 00:55:34,500
They asked if it was you.

551
00:55:41,583 --> 00:55:43,625
Yeah, they asked me the same thing.

552
00:55:46,375 --> 00:55:48,750
I told 'em you wouldn't hurt a fly.

553
00:56:02,500 --> 00:56:04,750
Aspirant Maximus.

554
00:56:04,833 --> 00:56:08,625
It is your most sacred duty
to protect the Brotherhood.

555
00:56:09,666 --> 00:56:14,083
After which, it is your most sacred duty
to protect the mission.

556
00:56:14,166 --> 00:56:18,291
After which, it is your most sacred duty

557
00:56:18,375 --> 00:56:21,875
to protect your lord Knight Titus.

558
00:56:25,041 --> 00:56:27,958
Do you accept?

559
00:56:51,166 --> 00:56:55,833
Our mission comes from the highest clerics

560
00:56:55,916 --> 00:56:59,166
in the Commonwealth.

561
00:56:59,250 --> 00:57:01,375
It is believed

562
00:57:01,458 --> 00:57:03,125
that a denizen

563
00:57:03,208 --> 00:57:05,041
of the Enclave

564
00:57:05,125 --> 00:57:06,666
has escaped.

565
00:57:06,750 --> 00:57:08,833
The Enclave's real?

566
00:57:08,916 --> 00:57:11,500
And that he has with him an object...

567
00:57:12,541 --> 00:57:15,583
...of profound potential...

568
00:57:16,916 --> 00:57:19,750
...to harm our nation

569
00:57:19,833 --> 00:57:21,583
or to save it.

570
00:57:22,583 --> 00:57:26,666
Each knight in this legion

571
00:57:26,750 --> 00:57:31,500
will search a section of the Wilds
for this target.

572
00:57:31,583 --> 00:57:33,250
Brothers...

573
00:57:33,333 --> 00:57:35,750
...we exist

574
00:57:35,833 --> 00:57:38,166
for moments such as these.

575
00:57:38,250 --> 00:57:41,208
Go forth

576
00:57:41,291 --> 00:57:43,333
with honor!

577
00:57:44,583 --> 00:57:46,875
And may the shape of the future

578
00:57:46,958 --> 00:57:49,250
be cut by your sword!

579
00:57:51,041 --> 00:57:53,791
Approximation of the target for your lord.

580
00:58:02,541 --> 00:58:05,375
You're dismissed, Aspirant.

581
00:59:46,666 --> 00:59:48,583
How do we know which grave?

582
00:59:48,666 --> 00:59:50,916
Well, Slim,
we look for the fresh one.

583
00:59:55,791 --> 00:59:58,625
Dom Pedro has our friend
dug up once a year.

584
00:59:58,708 --> 01:00:03,083
Cuts some pieces off
and puts him right back in the ground.

585
01:00:10,625 --> 01:00:12,875
Bingo.

586
01:00:12,958 --> 01:00:14,041
Shit.

587
01:00:14,125 --> 01:00:17,416
You're telling me
this supreme badass we're looking for

588
01:00:17,500 --> 01:00:18,958
is a godforsaken mutant?

589
01:00:19,041 --> 01:00:21,625
Have some respec'.

590
01:00:21,708 --> 01:00:24,791
That's your prospective coworker
you's talking about

591
01:00:24,875 --> 01:00:27,250
and our ticket to a big payoff.

592
01:00:27,333 --> 01:00:28,750
Thought you said you knew this guy.

593
01:00:28,833 --> 01:00:30,708
I said I knew of him.

594
01:00:31,708 --> 01:00:33,583
My pop worked with him once.

595
01:00:33,666 --> 01:00:35,083
Your pop?

596
01:00:35,166 --> 01:00:37,142
How long's this asshole
been moldering in the ground?

597
01:00:37,166 --> 01:00:38,458
How do we know he's not feral?

598
01:00:38,541 --> 01:00:40,416
That is why

599
01:00:40,500 --> 01:00:42,083
we brought...

600
01:00:42,166 --> 01:00:43,791
...our little friend.

601
01:00:43,875 --> 01:00:47,166
A feral ghoul can't abide a chicken.

602
01:00:48,333 --> 01:00:51,166
If he goes for her, we kill him.

603
01:01:04,125 --> 01:01:06,000
Whoa, whoa.

604
01:02:26,958 --> 01:02:27,958
Ah.

605
01:02:33,500 --> 01:02:36,041
Well, well, well.

606
01:02:36,125 --> 01:02:39,583
Why, is this an Amish production
of <i>The Count of Monte Cristo</i> or...

607
01:02:39,666 --> 01:02:43,833
just the weirdest circle jerk
I've ever been invited to?

608
01:02:52,583 --> 01:02:54,416
Welcome back.

609
01:02:54,500 --> 01:02:55,541
I'm Honcho.

610
01:02:55,625 --> 01:02:56,875
Now, you don't even know us...

611
01:02:56,958 --> 01:02:58,375
No.

612
01:02:58,458 --> 01:03:00,125
I do not.

613
01:03:13,041 --> 01:03:14,916
Does that count?

614
01:03:15,000 --> 01:03:17,291
Sh-Should I shoot him?

615
01:03:17,375 --> 01:03:19,833
Would you shut the fuck up?

616
01:03:19,916 --> 01:03:21,166
We, uh...

617
01:03:21,250 --> 01:03:23,458
we got a proposition for you.

618
01:03:23,541 --> 01:03:25,291
A bounty came down.

619
01:03:25,375 --> 01:03:26,958
A huge one.

620
01:03:27,041 --> 01:03:28,541
Enough to be a...

621
01:03:28,625 --> 01:03:31,541
last score for me and whoever's with me.

622
01:03:33,000 --> 01:03:36,166
Yeah. Now, somebody made a run...

623
01:03:37,750 --> 01:03:39,291
...from the Enclave.

624
01:03:40,375 --> 01:03:43,208
Well, what makes you think
I'd give a good goddamn about that?

625
01:03:43,291 --> 01:03:47,208
It ain't where they's running from
I figured you'd be interested in.

626
01:03:47,291 --> 01:03:48,666
It's where they's running to.

627
01:03:49,833 --> 01:03:52,666
That witch Moldaver.

628
01:03:53,833 --> 01:03:55,666
In California.

629
01:03:56,916 --> 01:03:58,666
That's where you from, ain't it?

630
01:04:00,083 --> 01:04:01,875
Originally, I mean.

631
01:04:07,541 --> 01:04:10,375
Now, what the fuck would you know
about where I'm from?

632
01:04:13,166 --> 01:04:16,708
Well, that don't sound
like gratitude, do it, boys?

633
01:04:18,083 --> 01:04:20,166
How about we put you
right back in that hole

634
01:04:20,250 --> 01:04:24,166
so Dom Pedro can have his fun with you
for the next 30 years?

635
01:04:33,125 --> 01:04:35,500
Well, I tell you what, boys,

636
01:04:35,583 --> 01:04:37,916
whenever somebody says...

637
01:04:39,000 --> 01:04:42,666
...they're doing one last job, that
usually means their heart's not in it.

638
01:04:42,750 --> 01:04:44,666
Probably never was.

639
01:04:46,916 --> 01:04:48,416
But for me,

640
01:04:48,500 --> 01:04:50,666
well...

641
01:04:50,750 --> 01:04:53,041
I do this shit for the love of the game.

642
01:05:31,458 --> 01:05:33,333
You right, friend,
about one thing.

643
01:05:36,291 --> 01:05:37,833
This right here

644
01:05:37,916 --> 01:05:40,750
was your last job.

645
01:05:40,833 --> 01:05:43,541
My paycheck wasn't quite
what you expected, but...

646
01:05:43,625 --> 01:05:45,916
well, you know what they say.

647
01:05:46,000 --> 01:05:47,916
Us cowpokes...

648
01:05:55,125 --> 01:05:57,708

<i>You need to go home.</i>

670
01:07:59,791 --> 01:08:02,125
Vault dwellers are
an endangered species here.

671
01:08:02,208 --> 01:08:04,791

the people of Vault 32 were up to,</i>

676

but it was anything but innocent.

677
01:08:25,708 --> 01:08:28,083
<i>What happened up here?</i>

678
01:08:29,083 --> 01:08:31,059
<i>I think everybody wants

679
01:08:31,083 --> 01:08:33,083

01:08:33,166 --> 01:08:35,458
