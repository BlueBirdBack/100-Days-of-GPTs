1
00:00:10,875 --> 00:00:12,125
<i>I cannot wait</i>

2
00:00:12,208 --> 00:00:14,875
to see the look on everyone's faces
when they see us

3
00:00:14,958 --> 00:00:16,625
return with the target.

4
00:00:18,083 --> 00:00:19,375
Maximus.

5
00:00:22,958 --> 00:00:25,791
This stinky old head's
mine now!

6
00:00:25,875 --> 00:00:28,875
You don't think it's weird that we always
elect an overseer from Vault 31?

7
00:00:28,958 --> 00:00:31,833
<i>Some of us will be
moving into Vault 32</i>

8
00:00:31,916 --> 00:00:33,916
<i>to start anew.</i>

9
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:35,875
<i>They killed my husband.</i>

10
00:00:35,916 --> 00:00:39,000
If your father were here, he...
he'd do the right thing.

11
00:00:39,083 --> 00:00:42,083
<i>I'm telling you,
radicalism is sweeping through Hollywood.</i>

12
00:00:42,166 --> 00:00:43,708
You should come to a meeting.

13
00:00:43,791 --> 00:00:46,125
<i>You should learn the truth
about where your wife works.</i>

14
00:00:46,208 --> 00:00:47,416
<i>Mr. Howard?</i>

15
00:00:47,500 --> 00:00:49,458
I'm a big fan.

16
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:53,583
Welcome to Vault 4.
Stay out of Level 12.

17
00:00:54,833 --> 00:00:56,753
<i>Where do you guys get
your power from?</i>

18
00:00:56,791 --> 00:00:58,791
I see you've found
our fusion core.

19
00:02:32,250 --> 00:02:34,791
Sandra, we're home.

20
00:02:52,166 --> 00:02:53,375
Sandra?

21
00:03:14,666 --> 00:03:16,291
Thank you, darling.

22
00:03:18,666 --> 00:03:20,625
Oh, wait.

23
00:03:20,708 --> 00:03:22,916
You thought...?

24
00:03:29,208 --> 00:03:30,541
Come on, now.

25
00:03:30,625 --> 00:03:33,250
Sandra, wait outside.

26
00:03:37,916 --> 00:03:40,541
Lead farming, huh?

27
00:03:40,625 --> 00:03:45,583
Why, hell, I probably still got
some of your lead in me somewhere.

28
00:03:47,208 --> 00:03:50,041
But today...

29
00:03:52,041 --> 00:03:53,833
...I'm just looking for information.

30
00:03:53,916 --> 00:03:56,291
I'll tell you anything,

31
00:03:56,375 --> 00:03:58,958
as long as you leave us in peace.

32
00:03:59,041 --> 00:04:02,875
Say, am I out of date,

33
00:04:02,958 --> 00:04:05,375
or did I hear you had three kids?

34
00:04:08,250 --> 00:04:11,000
I had an older son, but he's gone.

35
00:04:11,083 --> 00:04:14,750
He took up with that madwoman
in the hills two years ago.

36
00:04:14,833 --> 00:04:16,958
We haven't heard from him since.

37
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:19,000
Hmm.

38
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:23,916
There's always some new little faction,
ain't there?

39
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:27,166
Brand-new team of believers
with their own dumbass ideas

40
00:04:27,250 --> 00:04:29,833
about how they gonna save the world.

41
00:04:30,916 --> 00:04:35,750
What did you say the name
of your eldest was?

42
00:04:37,916 --> 00:04:39,333
Was it Roofus?

43
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:44,541
- I didn't say...
- That must make you Tommy.

44
00:04:47,541 --> 00:04:49,583
What did you do?

45
00:04:49,666 --> 00:04:52,166
- What is that envelope?
- Well, you see, daddy-o...

46
00:04:52,250 --> 00:04:54,666
now, from what I can tell...

47
00:04:54,750 --> 00:04:58,625
...Old Roofus got Tommy here mixed up
with that madwoman, too.

48
00:04:58,708 --> 00:05:00,250
Now, according to this,

49
00:05:00,333 --> 00:05:04,291
Roofus sent Tommy
a stash of caps to pay a courier

50
00:05:04,375 --> 00:05:09,375
for "the safe transport
of an Enclave defector"

51
00:05:09,458 --> 00:05:13,500
to that very same madwoman in the hills.

52
00:05:13,583 --> 00:05:15,708
Moldaver.

53
00:05:15,791 --> 00:05:18,125
But my problem is,

54
00:05:18,208 --> 00:05:21,333
by the time I got this letter
off your brother,

55
00:05:21,416 --> 00:05:24,000
it was a little bit hard to read.

56
00:05:26,083 --> 00:05:29,625
For some reason,
I just can't make out her location.

57
00:05:29,708 --> 00:05:32,208
Now, you give me that location,

58
00:05:32,291 --> 00:05:34,916
and I'll be on my way.

59
00:05:37,125 --> 00:05:38,833
I'm sorry.

60
00:05:38,916 --> 00:05:40,541
Tell him, son.

61
00:05:41,791 --> 00:05:43,000
Just tell him.

62
00:05:44,041 --> 00:05:45,892
I didn't want to spend my life
digging through dirt.

63
00:05:45,916 --> 00:05:48,083
I want to build something,
and we have the chance...

64
00:05:48,166 --> 00:05:49,559
Tell him what he wants to know!

65
00:05:49,583 --> 00:05:51,125
Or else he's gonna kill us all!

66
00:05:51,208 --> 00:05:54,208
Including your little sister.

67
00:05:56,750 --> 00:05:58,750
Huh.

68
00:06:06,166 --> 00:06:08,125
She's...

69
00:06:08,208 --> 00:06:10,250
she's at the Observatory.

70
00:06:13,708 --> 00:06:16,750
Now, please, leave us.

71
00:06:22,166 --> 00:06:24,458
So, what you think, Tommy?

72
00:06:24,541 --> 00:06:27,184
Am I really walking out of here today,
or are you gonna try and draw on me

73
00:06:27,208 --> 00:06:29,833
for what I did to your big brother?

74
00:06:32,375 --> 00:06:35,583
- He won't.
- Maybe not today,

75
00:06:35,666 --> 00:06:38,541
but maybe someday.

76
00:06:47,416 --> 00:06:48,875
Tommy!

77
00:07:26,916 --> 00:07:28,958
<i>What is it
about California,</i>

78
00:07:29,041 --> 00:07:31,958
<i>that we all came to this place?</i>

79
00:07:37,916 --> 00:07:40,458
Maybe it's the sunshine.

80
00:07:40,541 --> 00:07:43,125
Maybe it's the friendly people.

81
00:07:43,208 --> 00:07:47,791
When you think of the promise
of the American Dream,

82
00:07:47,875 --> 00:07:50,708
you think of California.

83
00:07:50,791 --> 00:07:54,083
But it is just a dream. It's not real.

84
00:07:54,166 --> 00:07:59,250
We were told the atom bomb
meant the end of war.

85
00:08:00,250 --> 00:08:01,750
That didn't work out, did it?

86
00:08:01,833 --> 00:08:04,708
We were told
America's always getting better,

87
00:08:04,791 --> 00:08:07,500
it's always moving toward a better future.

88
00:08:07,583 --> 00:08:11,666
But the future is getting closer,
and we can see it.

89
00:08:11,750 --> 00:08:16,291
Their "better future" is a cliff's edge.

90
00:08:16,375 --> 00:08:19,250
And it's coming up fast, isn't it?

91
00:08:19,333 --> 00:08:22,125
These soldiers that we're fighting abroad,

92
00:08:22,208 --> 00:08:24,833
their families,
we have more in common with them

93
00:08:24,916 --> 00:08:28,041
than we do with the people
here in power, the real enemy.

94
00:08:28,125 --> 00:08:29,726
That's about all the horseshit
I can take.

95
00:08:29,750 --> 00:08:31,500
Coop. Coop, come on.

96
00:08:31,583 --> 00:08:33,541
Mr. Howard?

97
00:08:33,625 --> 00:08:35,875
I'm sorry, I didn't hear what you said.

98
00:08:35,916 --> 00:08:38,291
I said that, um...

99
00:08:38,375 --> 00:08:40,833
this is about all the horseshit
I can take.

100
00:08:40,916 --> 00:08:44,208
I didn't realize that America's favorite gunslinger

101
00:08:44,291 --> 00:08:47,375
was so sensitive.

102
00:08:47,458 --> 00:08:50,875
I have my principles,
Miss Williams, that's all.

103
00:08:50,958 --> 00:08:54,666
Uh-huh. And those principles of yours...

104
00:08:54,750 --> 00:08:58,500
how much did Vault-Tec pay
to take them off your hands?

105
00:09:00,458 --> 00:09:02,000
Well, this is America.

106
00:09:02,083 --> 00:09:03,625
Everybody has a sponsor,

107
00:09:03,708 --> 00:09:06,375
and, uh, I'm not ashamed to earn a living.

108
00:09:06,458 --> 00:09:08,392
Vault-Tec is
the largest company in America.

109
00:09:08,416 --> 00:09:12,250
There's a lot of money
in selling the end of the world.

110
00:09:12,333 --> 00:09:14,684
Well, I'm sure there's a lot of money
in selling a political ideology

111
00:09:14,708 --> 00:09:16,392
- that ends in breadlines.
- Fascist.

112
00:09:16,416 --> 00:09:19,416
Okay, uh, sorry, this was a mistake.
We'll be leaving.

113
00:09:19,500 --> 00:09:23,291
Oh, no, I'm-I'm quite glad
you brought Mr. Howard today.

114
00:09:24,916 --> 00:09:27,208
You see, it happens

115
00:09:27,291 --> 00:09:29,958
that I know your wife.

116
00:09:30,041 --> 00:09:32,416
And perhaps a side of her you don't.

117
00:09:39,958 --> 00:09:41,083
How do you know my wife?

118
00:09:41,166 --> 00:09:43,708
My research company
was acquired by her division.

119
00:09:43,791 --> 00:09:48,041
We were developing this kind of technology
that's... difficult to monetize.

120
00:09:48,125 --> 00:09:51,041
Cold fusion. Infinite energy.

121
00:09:51,125 --> 00:09:53,291
That's what I was
on the verge of achieving

122
00:09:53,375 --> 00:09:57,583
when Vault-Tec swept in and bought up
every company I'd ever worked for.

123
00:09:57,666 --> 00:09:59,083
Every one of them?

124
00:09:59,166 --> 00:10:02,458
So, what are you, a millionaire communist?

125
00:10:02,541 --> 00:10:04,541
Hypocrisy is like violence in your movies.

126
00:10:04,625 --> 00:10:06,958
If you only let the bad guys use it,
the bad guys win.

127
00:10:07,041 --> 00:10:09,791
Yeah? I, uh, I got
a little showbiz secret for you.

128
00:10:09,875 --> 00:10:12,333
A good bad guy doesn't
see themselves as the bad guy.

129
00:10:12,416 --> 00:10:16,750
America has been locked in a resource war
for over a decade.

130
00:10:16,833 --> 00:10:19,666
Vault-Tec bought the means
to end that war,

131
00:10:19,750 --> 00:10:23,625
the same war you fought in,
so they could put it on the shelf.

132
00:10:23,708 --> 00:10:26,083
All because it didn't fit
into their business model.

133
00:10:26,166 --> 00:10:30,166
I want your help in getting it back.

134
00:10:37,250 --> 00:10:39,791
- What is it?
- It's a listening device.

135
00:10:39,875 --> 00:10:42,875
A listening device. You...

136
00:10:42,958 --> 00:10:44,625
you want me to spy on my wife?

137
00:10:55,416 --> 00:10:58,083
- Good luck with the revolution.
- You can keep it.

138
00:10:58,166 --> 00:10:59,708
As a token.

139
00:11:01,333 --> 00:11:03,708
I'm not a communist, Mr. Howard.

140
00:11:03,791 --> 00:11:08,916
That's just a dirty word they use
to describe people who aren't insane.

141
00:11:50,291 --> 00:11:52,166
We let you into our home.

142
00:11:52,250 --> 00:11:55,291
Tended to your wounds,
gave you food and water.

143
00:11:55,375 --> 00:11:57,541
But you had to go to Level 12.

144
00:11:57,625 --> 00:12:00,458
I saw what you were doing
to those poor women.

145
00:12:00,541 --> 00:12:03,625
You're experimenting on them.
It's... it's sick.

146
00:12:03,708 --> 00:12:05,625
She needs to see the holotape.

147
00:12:05,708 --> 00:12:08,458
All right. Play the tape.

148
00:12:11,291 --> 00:12:13,500
<i>Okay.</i>

149
00:12:15,583 --> 00:12:17,375
What is this?

150
00:12:17,458 --> 00:12:20,125
- Your history.
<i>- Overseer Hawthorne,</i>

151
00:12:20,208 --> 00:12:21,666
<i>final log entry.</i>

152
00:12:21,750 --> 00:12:23,666
<i>At this point,
it would be irrational of me</i>

153
00:12:23,750 --> 00:12:26,166
<i>not to acknowledge that these may be</i>

154
00:12:26,250 --> 00:12:28,000
<i>my last words.</i>

155
00:12:28,083 --> 00:12:30,958
<i>But despite our results here,</i>

156
00:12:31,041 --> 00:12:33,916
<i>I want to reiterate that a society
governed by scientists</i>

157
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:37,333
<i>- Honey! Hey!
- really is the ideal social structure.</i>

158
00:12:37,416 --> 00:12:41,500
<i>What happened here
should not be used as a case study</i>

159
00:12:41,583 --> 00:12:44,500
for what happens when scientists
are given unregulated control.

160
00:12:44,583 --> 00:12:46,458
- Lloyd, gimme a little help!
- And-and...

161
00:12:46,541 --> 00:12:47,916
and-and hybridizing humans

162
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:50,958
with radioactive-resistant species
still has potential.

163
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:54,583
<i>Our test subjects were</i>

164
00:12:54,666 --> 00:12:56,625
less compliant than we expected.

165
00:13:00,708 --> 00:13:03,291
Cassandra! Oh, no!

166
00:13:04,666 --> 00:13:07,208
No, no, no!

167
00:13:07,291 --> 00:13:08,875
No!

168
00:13:25,166 --> 00:13:27,458
Sorry, I haven't, uh,

169
00:13:27,541 --> 00:13:29,583
seen that footage in a long time.

170
00:13:31,416 --> 00:13:32,708
But it's a stirring reminder

171
00:13:32,791 --> 00:13:35,541
of what this place is all about.

172
00:13:36,583 --> 00:13:39,208
I-I don't understand, I...

173
00:13:39,291 --> 00:13:42,291
In the lab, I-I saw your doctors...

174
00:13:42,375 --> 00:13:44,291
Trying to ease the pain of the poor souls

175
00:13:44,375 --> 00:13:47,041
your people lured into this place.

176
00:13:47,125 --> 00:13:49,500
His ancestors were used as lab rats

177
00:13:49,583 --> 00:13:52,333
by the original residents of Vault 4.

178
00:13:52,416 --> 00:13:54,625
- Until the lab rats rebelled.
- The, uh,

179
00:13:54,708 --> 00:13:58,625
creature in the video was actually
my Great-Uncle Peter on my mom's side.

180
00:14:01,500 --> 00:14:03,708
I'm so sorry.

181
00:14:03,791 --> 00:14:05,541
I...

182
00:14:05,625 --> 00:14:10,500
I had no idea the original vault dwellers
here were so... so weird.

183
00:14:10,583 --> 00:14:13,458
I mean, my vault's not like this.

184
00:14:14,541 --> 00:14:18,041
What was the experiment in 33?

185
00:14:18,125 --> 00:14:21,750
W-Well, there is no experiment.

186
00:14:25,875 --> 00:14:28,708
Your ignorance cannot excuse your cruelty.

187
00:14:28,791 --> 00:14:30,958
You have infected our home with violence

188
00:14:31,041 --> 00:14:33,916
and now you must pay the price.

189
00:14:36,375 --> 00:14:37,458
No!

190
00:14:37,541 --> 00:14:40,291

205
00:15:52,666 --> 00:15:55,166
Oh, shit.

206
00:15:55,250 --> 00:15:57,375
I'm gonna fucking die.

207
00:15:57,458 --> 00:16:01,375
Ow, hey! That's my foot,
it's not food, okay?

208
00:16:02,708 --> 00:16:04,083
You know what?

209
00:16:04,166 --> 00:16:07,208
If you were a person, you wouldn't
have any friends, you realize that?

210
00:16:09,833 --> 00:16:12,291
Okay, I got to reevaluate here.

211
00:16:12,375 --> 00:16:13,666
What do I need, what do I need?

212
00:16:13,750 --> 00:16:15,958
This fucking stupid thing.
Oh, you want this too, huh?

213
00:16:16,041 --> 00:16:19,625
Everybody wants this.
Guess what? It's mine.

214
00:16:19,708 --> 00:16:21,458
You think everything's for you.

215
00:16:21,541 --> 00:16:24,041
It's pretty selfish, actually,
you know that?

216
00:16:24,125 --> 00:16:26,708
Bite what you want to bite,
go where you want to go.

217
00:16:26,791 --> 00:16:29,291
It's always something.

218
00:16:29,375 --> 00:16:30,875
Okay.

219
00:16:30,958 --> 00:16:32,791
Oh, hell yeah.

220
00:16:32,875 --> 00:16:34,500
You can't eat this.

221
00:16:43,625 --> 00:16:45,000
You know what?

222
00:16:48,083 --> 00:16:50,583
Oh, yeah, this is great.

223
00:16:50,666 --> 00:16:52,541
Lot of space.

224
00:16:52,625 --> 00:16:54,208
You're a loose cannon, all right?

225
00:16:54,291 --> 00:16:56,934
This is a very important mission
and I can't have you jeopardizing it.

226
00:16:56,958 --> 00:16:59,375
It's bigger than you.
It's bigger than all of us.

227
00:17:03,625 --> 00:17:05,375
Great.

228
00:17:05,458 --> 00:17:08,000
Oh, see? You got a little window
and everything.

229
00:17:08,125 --> 00:17:10,250
You'll be fine.

230
00:17:13,958 --> 00:17:15,238
You can breathe in there, right?

231
00:17:16,875 --> 00:17:19,083
All right, got a radio tower to find.

232
00:17:19,166 --> 00:17:23,041
Got to contact the Brotherhood,
get them this head,

233
00:17:23,125 --> 00:17:25,525
and get me some glory.

234
00:17:33,083 --> 00:17:36,375
We are all survivors here.

235
00:17:36,458 --> 00:17:38,125
Lucky enough to have found

236
00:17:38,208 --> 00:17:40,500
this sanctum of peace.

237
00:17:40,583 --> 00:17:42,125
Of tolerance.

238
00:17:42,208 --> 00:17:44,833
It doesn't matter

239
00:17:44,916 --> 00:17:47,541
where you come from or what you believe.

240
00:17:47,625 --> 00:17:50,125
You deserve safety.

241
00:17:56,291 --> 00:17:57,458
Unless...

242
00:18:03,666 --> 00:18:06,125
...you threaten that peace.

243
00:18:20,041 --> 00:18:22,666
For causing harm

244
00:18:22,750 --> 00:18:25,250
to a fellow survivor,

245
00:18:25,333 --> 00:18:29,583
you are hereby sentenced to death...

246
00:18:30,583 --> 00:18:34,083
...by banishment to the surface!

247
00:18:49,375 --> 00:18:50,833
It's almost there.

248
00:18:52,750 --> 00:18:55,458
Need to get that sharpened, please.

249
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:06,375
Yeah!

250
00:19:09,791 --> 00:19:13,458
You're just... letting me go?

251
00:19:14,708 --> 00:19:18,541
Well, that's certainly
an optimistic perspective.

252
00:19:18,625 --> 00:19:21,916
You'll be killed almost immediately
on the surface

253
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:24,208
by Lord knows what.

254
00:19:24,291 --> 00:19:27,333
That's why we're giving you
two weeks of supplies to take with you.

255
00:19:27,416 --> 00:19:28,517
- Thank you, Cathy.
- Sure.

256
00:19:28,541 --> 00:19:31,208
After that, you are on your own, Goosey.

257
00:19:32,208 --> 00:19:34,541
Uh...

258
00:19:34,625 --> 00:19:36,125
That's, uh...

259
00:19:37,416 --> 00:19:40,708
That's... really nice of you guys.

260
00:19:40,791 --> 00:19:42,666
Okay, and now it is time

261
00:19:42,750 --> 00:19:45,125
to be moving along.

262
00:19:46,125 --> 00:19:47,916
Can I just ask you one thing?

263
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:51,291
Obviously, someone will carry the supplies
to the surface for you.

264
00:19:51,375 --> 00:19:54,000
My friend really likes it here.

265
00:19:54,083 --> 00:19:55,958
And he's a good person.

266
00:19:56,041 --> 00:19:59,833
He deserves to be somewhere nice and safe,

267
00:19:59,916 --> 00:20:01,333
like this.

268
00:20:01,416 --> 00:20:03,666

They're letting me go.

284
00:21:19,375 --> 00:21:20,458
Really?

285
00:21:20,541 --> 00:21:21,875
Yeah.

286
00:21:23,333 --> 00:21:24,833
Oops.

287
00:21:26,916 --> 00:21:28,416
Sorry.

288
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:32,791
Somebody maybe check on him.

289
00:21:45,583 --> 00:21:47,333
What?

290
00:21:49,125 --> 00:21:51,375
We stole their fusion core.

291
00:21:51,458 --> 00:21:53,416
Well, yeah, but...

292
00:21:55,416 --> 00:21:57,666
You know, I needed it for the armor.

293
00:21:57,750 --> 00:21:59,434
Well, without their fusion core,
their auxiliary power

294
00:21:59,458 --> 00:22:01,750
will only last a few days, and...

295
00:22:01,833 --> 00:22:03,083
and then what?

296
00:22:05,166 --> 00:22:08,083
No... No.

297
00:22:08,166 --> 00:22:09,708
- Yes.
- No.

298
00:22:09,791 --> 00:22:11,875
Giving it back is the right thing to do.

299
00:22:11,958 --> 00:22:14,000
Without the fusion core,
this armor is useless.

300
00:22:14,083 --> 00:22:15,250
I can't be a knight.

301
00:22:15,333 --> 00:22:16,666
Well...

302
00:22:16,750 --> 00:22:19,333
you can't be a knight
by stealing from people either.

303
00:22:19,416 --> 00:22:21,791
Yeah, but I can help people
with this armor.

304
00:22:21,875 --> 00:22:23,708
All right?

305
00:22:23,791 --> 00:22:26,166
You, for example. I want to help you.

306
00:22:26,250 --> 00:22:29,208
You really want give them
their fusion core back

307
00:22:29,291 --> 00:22:30,875
if it means you don't get your dad?

308
00:22:32,791 --> 00:22:36,041
If my dad found out
that I destroyed an entire community

309
00:22:36,125 --> 00:22:37,875
to save him...

310
00:22:41,541 --> 00:22:43,208
...that'd break his heart.

311
00:22:50,333 --> 00:22:51,833
I can't.

312
00:23:26,041 --> 00:23:28,041
Come on.

313
00:24:00,416 --> 00:24:02,083
Thank you!

314
00:24:08,041 --> 00:24:10,291
Thinking 'bout those oysters?

315
00:24:10,375 --> 00:24:12,375
Mm-hmm.

316
00:24:28,791 --> 00:24:31,458
We don't have oysters in my vault.

317
00:24:32,583 --> 00:24:34,666
We have canned tuna.

318
00:24:35,666 --> 00:24:38,041
But if you like oysters,

319
00:24:38,125 --> 00:24:40,458
I'm pretty sure you'll like canned tuna.

320
00:24:47,791 --> 00:24:51,166
I was supposed to marry a stranger
from another vault.

321
00:24:52,250 --> 00:24:55,958
It didn't turn out so good.

322
00:24:56,041 --> 00:24:59,250
I don't have the best luck
when it comes to strangers.

323
00:25:02,833 --> 00:25:04,750
But...

324
00:25:04,833 --> 00:25:06,541
Titus...

325
00:25:07,750 --> 00:25:10,708
I can honestly say

326
00:25:10,791 --> 00:25:12,166
you are the best stranger

327
00:25:12,250 --> 00:25:14,916
that I've ever met.

328
00:25:15,000 --> 00:25:18,833
You're a good person, Titus.

329
00:25:18,916 --> 00:25:22,000
And if you wanted to,

330
00:25:22,083 --> 00:25:24,708
when all of this is over, you could come

331
00:25:24,791 --> 00:25:27,791
and live with us in Vault 33.

332
00:25:33,875 --> 00:25:35,375
With me.

333
00:25:45,125 --> 00:25:46,583
There's something I should tell you.

334
00:25:46,666 --> 00:25:48,125
Just say yes.

335
00:25:48,208 --> 00:25:50,583
My name isn't Titus. It's Maximus.

336
00:25:50,666 --> 00:25:54,583
Titus is the name of the knight
who owned this suit before me.

337
00:25:59,083 --> 00:26:02,666
He was threatening me, so instead
of helping him I watched him die.

338
00:26:02,750 --> 00:26:05,916
And I took his armor and I lied to you.

339
00:26:08,750 --> 00:26:11,875
So, all that stuff you were saying,
you know, about, um,

340
00:26:11,958 --> 00:26:14,125
about me being a good person...

341
00:26:27,958 --> 00:26:31,458
I just threw acid
in an innocent man's face.

342
00:26:31,541 --> 00:26:33,750
And I've only been up here two weeks.

343
00:26:36,458 --> 00:26:38,208
The wasteland sucks.

344
00:26:42,291 --> 00:26:45,166
Yeah. Sometimes.

345
00:26:49,666 --> 00:26:52,333
Do you want to come
live with me in my vault?

346
00:26:55,416 --> 00:26:57,541
Yeah.

347
00:26:57,625 --> 00:26:59,500
Yeah, of course.

348
00:27:15,958 --> 00:27:17,666
Let's go find that head.

00:27:42,666 --> 00:27:44,625
<i>So, I'd encourage you to sit back</i>

355
00:27:44,708 --> 00:27:47,125
<i>and enjoy the folksy, gutsy sound</i>

356
00:27:47,208 --> 00:27:48,833
<i>of bygone fiddlers.</i>

357
00:27:48,916 --> 00:27:50,916
<i>And, if you don't like what you hear,</i>

358
00:27:51,000 --> 00:27:53,958
<i>just a reminder that
I don't take visitors at the station.</i>

359
00:27:54,041 --> 00:27:58,416
<i>A simple postcard will suffice.
That said, enjoy the fiddling.</i>

360
00:28:42,916 --> 00:28:44,583
- Excuse me!
- Aah!

361
00:28:44,666 --> 00:28:47,458
Don't kill me. I'm a doctor.
I can help you.

362
00:28:51,625 --> 00:28:55,166
Haven't run into many people
traveling with a human head.

363
00:28:55,250 --> 00:28:58,250
Oh, this? It's not...
It's nothing really, it's more of a...

364
00:28:58,333 --> 00:29:00,833
I have to...
It's a souvenir kind of thing.

365
00:29:00,916 --> 00:29:01,958
Oh, yeah?

366
00:29:02,041 --> 00:29:04,750
Welcome to my humble pharmacy.

367
00:29:04,833 --> 00:29:06,726
<i>Have a seat,
my dear boy,</i>

368
00:29:06,750 --> 00:29:09,041
and let's take a look at that

369
00:29:09,125 --> 00:29:11,291
tattered tootsy of yours.

370
00:29:18,666 --> 00:29:20,875
Oh...

371
00:29:20,958 --> 00:29:23,125
Oh.

372
00:29:23,208 --> 00:29:24,488
I've seen this condition before.

373
00:29:24,541 --> 00:29:27,000
Uh, someone stepped on my foot.

374
00:29:27,083 --> 00:29:29,333
Yes. Sometimes fatal.

375
00:29:29,416 --> 00:29:31,791
But you're in luck,
'cause I've got the cure.

376
00:29:31,875 --> 00:29:34,833
I have, in my possession,
serums and potions

377
00:29:34,916 --> 00:29:36,916
for every malady and misfortune

378
00:29:37,000 --> 00:29:38,750
that could possibly beset

379
00:29:38,833 --> 00:29:40,353
a wandering traveler such as yourself.

380
00:29:50,583 --> 00:29:52,017
What's stopping me from just killing you

381
00:29:52,041 --> 00:29:53,916
and taking your whole thing of drugs?

382
00:29:54,000 --> 00:29:56,791
Well, when it comes to serums,

383
00:29:56,875 --> 00:29:58,267
not many people know the difference

384
00:29:58,291 --> 00:30:01,041
between the noxious and the benign.

385
00:30:01,125 --> 00:30:04,750
A murky hue of green could aid the humors.

386
00:30:04,833 --> 00:30:07,166
A brackish tint of shamrock, and...

387
00:30:09,750 --> 00:30:11,541
That's the sound of your lower intestine

388
00:30:11,625 --> 00:30:13,583
falling right the fuck out.

389
00:30:14,666 --> 00:30:16,916
But which is which?

390
00:30:17,000 --> 00:30:18,416
- Which is which...
- Fine.

391
00:30:18,500 --> 00:30:21,291
- Just give me the right one.
- Okay.

392
00:30:22,500 --> 00:30:25,625
Before we start,
there's the small matter of my fee.

393
00:30:28,125 --> 00:30:30,458
I don't have caps, but...

394
00:30:33,583 --> 00:30:35,166
Oh, my.

395
00:30:35,250 --> 00:30:37,875
- Is-is that a...
- Fusion core?

396
00:30:39,000 --> 00:30:41,458
You don't see those around
much anymore, do you?

397
00:30:42,958 --> 00:30:45,583
But, if you do want to survive...

398
00:30:47,708 --> 00:30:49,458
...not a bad trade.

399
00:30:53,791 --> 00:30:56,250
Okay, here.

400
00:30:57,208 --> 00:30:59,791
Okay, let's get started.

401
00:31:11,833 --> 00:31:15,250
This elixir I have concocted heals all.

402
00:31:16,291 --> 00:31:18,375
And I mean everything.

403
00:31:18,458 --> 00:31:20,916
But I must warn you, the taste: not great.

404
00:31:21,000 --> 00:31:22,333
- Just give it.
- Okay.

405
00:31:27,708 --> 00:31:29,125
I'm sorry!

406
00:31:34,666 --> 00:31:36,250
But the results...

407
00:31:36,333 --> 00:31:38,791
Yes? The results.

408
00:31:46,541 --> 00:31:48,958
Holy shit. Holy shit!

409
00:31:49,041 --> 00:31:50,750
Ah, thank you.

410
00:31:50,833 --> 00:31:53,416
- Sure thing, buddy boy.
- Ah...

411
00:31:55,958 --> 00:31:58,125
Do you know where
I can find a radio tower?

412
00:31:58,208 --> 00:32:00,333
I have to make contact with my base.

413
00:32:00,416 --> 00:32:02,666
Yes, I believe there's one yonward.

414
00:32:02,750 --> 00:32:05,333
Past the big crater
in the middle of the Shithole.

415
00:32:05,416 --> 00:32:07,958
It's near a town
that used to be called Shady Sands.

416
00:32:08,041 --> 00:32:09,500
Shady Sands?

417
00:32:09,583 --> 00:32:10,934
That place is radioactive as hell.

418
00:32:10,958 --> 00:32:14,083
Well, you don't have to worry about that
anymore, do you, buddy boy?

419
00:32:15,500 --> 00:32:18,833
Toodles and anon.

We don't know.

437
00:33:54,250 --> 00:33:56,625
The medic says it looks like rat poison.

438
00:33:56,708 --> 00:33:59,250
We'll find out who was behind it.

What did I tell you, Norman?

444
00:34:13,000 --> 00:34:15,000
Words have meaning.

445
00:34:19,791 --> 00:34:22,375
People are gonna be upset
when they hear about this.

446
00:34:23,416 --> 00:34:26,458
People like to have
something to fuss about.

447
00:34:48,291 --> 00:34:49,625
Oh, fuck.

448
00:34:49,708 --> 00:34:51,708
Oh...

449
00:35:00,000 --> 00:35:01,166
Yes.

450
00:35:38,000 --> 00:35:39,500
Oh, hi, Norm.

451
00:35:39,583 --> 00:35:43,000
Oh, it-it's just terrible

452
00:35:43,083 --> 00:35:45,083
about the raiders, isn't it?

453
00:35:49,083 --> 00:35:50,375
Don't be too long.

454
00:35:50,458 --> 00:35:52,625
I'm holding the baby,
so you have to pack everything.

455
00:35:55,208 --> 00:35:57,125
We'll miss you, Norm.

456
00:35:58,125 --> 00:35:59,125
Hmm.

457
00:36:02,166 --> 00:36:03,750
You're going too?

458
00:36:03,833 --> 00:36:05,500
Yeah.

459
00:36:05,583 --> 00:36:08,125
Steph and I were given
a starter home unit.

460
00:36:08,208 --> 00:36:10,041
Just the three of us.

461
00:36:10,125 --> 00:36:11,458
Oh.

462
00:36:11,541 --> 00:36:14,250
So you're just gonna
forget about everything we've seen?

463
00:36:15,333 --> 00:36:18,666
I feel like this is a good moment
for a fresh start.

464
00:36:19,958 --> 00:36:21,291
You think so?

465
00:36:22,458 --> 00:36:24,000
Someone obviously does.

466
00:36:24,083 --> 00:36:25,458
Chet.

467
00:36:28,708 --> 00:36:30,750
You're a coward.

468
00:36:30,833 --> 00:36:32,625
You know that, Chet?

469
00:36:36,166 --> 00:36:37,791
We all are, Norm.

470
00:36:39,208 --> 00:36:41,375
That's why we live in a vault.

471
00:38:07,125 --> 00:38:08,875
All right.

472
00:38:08,958 --> 00:38:11,041

two marshmallow, one plain.

480
00:39:10,583 --> 00:39:11,958
Three? You have one for me?

00:39:12,041 --> 00:39:14,250
- Yeah.
- Okay.

482

You're right, Roosevelt.

491
00:39:49,166 --> 00:39:50,833
What are you thinking?

492
00:40:01,333 --> 00:40:04,000
<i>Lloyd and Cassandra here
are both scientists,</i>

493
00:40:04,083 --> 00:40:07,291
<i>specializing in the effects

494
00:40:07,375 --> 00:40:10,208
<i>That's right,

495

<i>Well, I may be a hero in the movies,</i>

498
00:40:17,250 --> 00:40:19,625
<i>but you all are heroes in real life.</i>

499
00:40:42,125 --> 00:40:44,791
No dogs in the vault, huh?

500
00:41:12,458 --> 00:41:15,666
I'm sorry, Dogmeat, but you ain't him.

501
00:41:50,083 --> 00:41:52,666
Yeah, my, uh, ride
should be getting here any minute.

502
00:41:52,750 --> 00:41:55,458
Thanks again for letting me
use your radio. That was really nice.

503
00:41:55,541 --> 00:41:57,333
Nah, no problem.

504
00:42:00,541 --> 00:42:02,458
So, you were saying earlier
that some people,

505
00:42:02,541 --> 00:42:04,517
they don't, uh, like the sound
of this music, really?

506
00:42:04,541 --> 00:42:06,708
Oh, people get fully mad.

507
00:42:06,791 --> 00:42:08,666
- Oh.
- The thing no one appreciates is

508
00:42:08,750 --> 00:42:10,708
these are the original recordings.

509
00:42:10,791 --> 00:42:12,500
Oh. Uh-huh.

510
00:42:12,583 --> 00:42:14,791
You can't get that warm sound anymore.

511
00:42:14,875 --> 00:42:17,166
You know, the bass, the treble,

512
00:42:17,250 --> 00:42:19,208
the mids.

513
00:42:19,291 --> 00:42:20,583
Oh, that...

514
00:42:20,666 --> 00:42:22,750
Right, yeah. Oh.

515
00:42:22,833 --> 00:42:23,916
Here.

516
00:42:24,000 --> 00:42:25,625
Oh, that... Okay, yeah.

517
00:42:27,250 --> 00:42:29,833
That's the, uh,
that's mids, right?

518
00:42:29,916 --> 00:42:31,333
- Yeah, yeah.
- Yeah.

519
00:42:31,416 --> 00:42:33,583
Wow, that's really got that

520
00:42:33,666 --> 00:42:35,041
- Yeah.
- thing on it.

521
00:42:35,125 --> 00:42:36,445
Well, it's not on it, it's in it.

522
00:42:36,500 --> 00:42:38,958
Oh, yeah, I like it. A lot, yeah.

523
00:42:39,041 --> 00:42:41,875
Some people,
they're just so ignorant to music,

524
00:42:41,958 --> 00:42:43,500
it's kind of sad, I would say.

525
00:42:43,583 --> 00:42:45,625
- Totally.
- Yep.

526
00:42:47,708 --> 00:42:50,250
Great job on these booby traps,
by the way.

527
00:42:50,333 --> 00:42:51,625
Really good.

528
00:42:51,708 --> 00:42:53,166
Hey, thanks.

529
00:42:59,166 --> 00:43:01,291
Yeah.

530
00:43:01,375 --> 00:43:02,791
That one's crazy.

531
00:43:02,875 --> 00:43:05,333
Critics.

532
00:43:07,916 --> 00:43:09,583
Yeah.

533
00:43:09,666 --> 00:43:13,291
People just, uh, can't be nice.

534
00:43:14,333 --> 00:43:15,375
Hey, is this your ride?

535
00:43:15,458 --> 00:43:16,458
Huh?

536
00:43:18,375 --> 00:43:20,750
Oh, shit.

537
00:43:20,833 --> 00:43:22,208
Guess not. Okay.

538
00:43:31,291 --> 00:43:32,458
Mm.

539
00:43:35,833 --> 00:43:38,250
God, I suck without a scope.

540
00:43:42,291 --> 00:43:43,791
We just want the head.

541
00:43:43,875 --> 00:43:45,125
Who are you?

542
00:43:45,208 --> 00:43:48,166
I'm the person who cut it off.

543
00:43:48,250 --> 00:43:49,791
Okay, um...

544
00:44:00,541 --> 00:44:02,000
Uh...

545
00:44:03,250 --> 00:44:05,041
Oh...

546
00:44:09,041 --> 00:44:11,416
Why am I not dead?

547
00:44:19,041 --> 00:44:20,500
Uh, I... I-I wouldn't do that.

548
00:44:20,583 --> 00:44:22,375
Well, I'm not just gonna leave it there.

549
00:44:24,041 --> 00:44:25,500
Oh.

550
00:44:25,583 --> 00:44:27,250
- Oh. Oh!
- No.

551
00:44:27,333 --> 00:44:29,208
Oh...

552
00:44:32,250 --> 00:44:34,291
Uh...

553
00:44:34,375 --> 00:44:36,708
Uh...

554
00:44:38,333 --> 00:44:39,833
Thaddeus.

555
00:44:41,375 --> 00:44:43,791
I-I think you might be a ghoul.

556
00:44:44,833 --> 00:44:46,833
Oh, no.

557
00:44:46,916 --> 00:44:48,958
Aw.

558
00:44:49,041 --> 00:44:51,083
I'm so stupid. I should've never trusted

559
00:44:51,166 --> 00:44:53,833
a doctor that smelled like that.

560
00:45:00,625 --> 00:45:02,291
Oh, boy.

561
00:45:09,083 --> 00:45:11,166
The Brotherhood.

562
00:45:12,791 --> 00:45:14,166
Oh, fuck.

563
00:45:14,250 --> 00:45:15,500
Shit.

564
00:45:16,666 --> 00:45:19,375
Oh, fuck! Oh, fuck.

565
00:45:19,458 --> 00:45:21,250
- They'll kill me if they find out.
- What?

566
00:45:21,333 --> 00:45:23,625
This-this is good, no?
The Brotherhood is the good guys?

567
00:45:23,708 --> 00:45:26,500
Uh, it's a complicated organization.

568
00:45:27,541 --> 00:45:29,666
- Thaddeus, give me the head.
- Huh?

569
00:45:29,750 --> 00:45:31,101
I'll slow them down.
You'll have time to run.

570
00:45:31,125 --> 00:45:33,000
You'd do that for me?

571
00:45:33,083 --> 00:45:35,000
Give it to me.

572
00:45:35,083 --> 00:45:36,291
Oh, thank you.

573
00:45:36,375 --> 00:45:38,041
Uh, I'm sorry about...

574
00:45:38,125 --> 00:45:40,375
a lot of things and I didn't mean for...

575
00:45:40,458 --> 00:45:42,625
Okay. Ni-Nice meeting you. Bye.

576
00:45:52,166 --> 00:45:54,208
What are you doing?

577
00:45:57,333 --> 00:46:00,083
If they want a head,
I'm gonna give them a head.

578
00:46:02,416 --> 00:46:04,000
Find your dad.

579
00:46:04,083 --> 00:46:05,875
- Go home. That's what I want for you.
- No.

580
00:46:05,958 --> 00:46:07,184
You're supposed to come with me.

581
00:46:07,208 --> 00:46:09,101
They're never gonna stop
looking for the artifact.

582
00:46:09,125 --> 00:46:11,291
I'm-I'm not leaving. I'm not leaving.

583
00:46:11,375 --> 00:46:12,750

Find me.

595
00:46:52,250 --> 00:46:53,500
I will.

596
00:46:54,500 --> 00:46:56,458

<i>who are leaving us for Vault 32.</i>

600
00:47:28,875 --> 00:47:32,208
Each of them have been chosen
for their agreeability,

601
00:47:32,291 --> 00:47:34,041
stick-to-itiveness,

602
00:47:34,125 --> 00:47:36,583
and all of the other qualities

603
00:47:36,666 --> 00:47:39,041
that make for a successful pioneer.

604
00:47:39,125 --> 00:47:41,791
- And, of course, every vault...
- I'm not going.

605
00:47:41,875 --> 00:47:43,500
I'm not going.
I'm not going.

606
00:47:43,583 --> 00:47:45,375
I'm not going, I'm not going.

607
00:47:45,458 --> 00:47:48,166
I'm not going. I'm not... Um, excuse me.

608
00:47:48,250 --> 00:47:50,000
Uh, I don't-I don't live there.

609
00:47:50,083 --> 00:47:51,875
I live-I live there.

610
00:47:58,416 --> 00:48:01,291
Sorry. Sorry. Sorry.

611
00:48:01,375 --> 00:48:03,833
That was weird. Um, sorry.

612
00:48:03,916 --> 00:48:06,000
I'm fine.

613
00:48:06,083 --> 00:48:07,666
Proceed.

614
00:48:07,750 --> 00:48:09,875
Thank you.

615
00:48:09,958 --> 00:48:13,666
And of course, every vault
needs an overseer.

616
00:48:13,750 --> 00:48:17,375
Which is why I have conferred
with the high council.

617
00:48:17,458 --> 00:48:20,250
And we are proud to announce

618
00:48:20,333 --> 00:48:23,958
as interim overseer of Vault 32,

619
00:48:24,041 --> 00:48:26,125
Stephanie Harper.

620
00:48:32,125 --> 00:48:33,458
And with that,

621
00:48:33,541 --> 00:48:36,458
now our friends

622
00:48:36,541 --> 00:48:38,666
become neighbors.

623
00:48:38,750 --> 00:48:41,125
Good luck, 32ers.

624
00:48:41,208 --> 00:48:42,541
