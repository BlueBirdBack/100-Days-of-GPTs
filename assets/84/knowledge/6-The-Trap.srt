1
00:00:10,541 --> 00:00:12,416
<i>The audience...</i>

2
00:00:12,500 --> 00:00:14,166
<i>they want to see that even</i>

3
00:00:14,250 --> 00:00:15,750
a good man as yourself can be

4
00:00:15,833 --> 00:00:18,351
- driven too far.
- Yeah, I understand that, but that's not really my thing.

5
00:00:25,083 --> 00:00:26,458
Why can't you move?

6
00:00:26,541 --> 00:00:28,101
<i>Someone stole my fusion core.</i>

7
00:00:28,166 --> 00:00:29,750
What are you suggesting?

8
00:00:29,833 --> 00:00:33,250
We travel together, get the head
and take it to the Brotherhood.

9
00:00:33,291 --> 00:00:36,916
<i>In exchange, you'll lend me the services
of your knights to save my father.</i>

10
00:00:37,500 --> 00:00:40,309
<i>You know, I've never done an advertisement before</i>

11
00:00:40,333 --> 00:00:41,333
in my life.

12
00:00:46,750 --> 00:00:48,625
<i>I wonder if anyone survived.</i>

13
00:00:48,708 --> 00:00:50,333
I did.

14
00:00:51,416 --> 00:00:52,416
<i>Lucy!</i>

15
00:00:58,250 --> 00:00:59,791
<i>Where are we?</i>

16
00:00:59,875 --> 00:01:01,791
We're in the best place in the world.

17
00:01:04,625 --> 00:01:06,750
<i>We're in a vault.</i>

18
00:01:28,583 --> 00:01:30,041
Oh.

19
00:01:30,125 --> 00:01:31,833
Hello there.

20
00:01:31,916 --> 00:01:34,041
Yep, it's me, Cooper Howard,

21
00:01:34,125 --> 00:01:36,791
star of stage and screen.

22
00:01:36,875 --> 00:01:39,875
But I'm not here today
to talk to you about my latest picture.

23
00:01:39,958 --> 00:01:45,333
No, today I'm here to show you
a vast and wonderful place,

24
00:01:45,416 --> 00:01:49,458
not made by God Almighty
but the working man.

25
00:01:49,541 --> 00:01:52,583
A veritable Camelot of the nuclear age.

26
00:01:52,666 --> 00:01:55,041
Now, how 'bout we turn on some lights.

27
00:01:57,500 --> 00:01:59,541
There, that's better.

28
00:02:03,041 --> 00:02:05,916
Now, I'm speaking to you from
deep inside the fully-livable

29
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:09,625
Model 96JQ1164.

30
00:02:09,666 --> 00:02:11,875
And what a beaut she is.

31
00:02:12,875 --> 00:02:14,875
And what a song she sings.

32
00:02:14,958 --> 00:02:18,708
Now, that right there
is Vault 4's three-foot-thick lead casing.

33
00:02:18,791 --> 00:02:21,125
Strong enough to keep out the rads

34
00:02:21,208 --> 00:02:23,166
and the Reds.

35
00:02:26,375 --> 00:02:28,208
Each one of these underground burghs

36
00:02:28,291 --> 00:02:30,916
comes with all the modern amenities
you've come to expect

37
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:33,333
from our rip-roarin' republic.

38
00:02:33,416 --> 00:02:35,750
Now, this corridor here
is Sycamore Street,

39
00:02:35,833 --> 00:02:39,208
where you'll wave howdy
to any one of your 200 neighbors

40
00:02:39,291 --> 00:02:42,791
on your way home for an enchanted evening
with your loved ones.

41
00:02:42,875 --> 00:02:43,916
Mm.

42
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:45,750
Meet the Hawthornes.

43
00:02:45,833 --> 00:02:49,125
Now, this isn't just your average
all-American family.

44
00:02:49,208 --> 00:02:51,833
No, Lloyd and Cassandra here
are both scientists,

45
00:02:51,916 --> 00:02:55,125
specializing in the effects of radiation
on human DNA.

46
00:02:55,208 --> 00:02:56,458
That's right.

47
00:02:56,541 --> 00:02:59,583
And we'll be living
and working right here in Vault 4,

48
00:02:59,666 --> 00:03:02,958
leading a community
governed entirely by scientists.

49
00:03:03,041 --> 00:03:04,958
Wait a second,
did you say "living down here"?

50
00:03:05,041 --> 00:03:07,666
Well, there hasn't been
a nuclear incident, has there?

51
00:03:07,750 --> 00:03:08,875
Uh, no, not yet.

52
00:03:08,958 --> 00:03:13,250
But, uh, our family
and a group of 80 volunteers

53
00:03:13,333 --> 00:03:16,083
will be conducting
a five-year trial of Vault 4.

54
00:03:16,166 --> 00:03:18,375
To demonstrate to the world that,

55
00:03:18,458 --> 00:03:21,041
no matter what comes our way,

56
00:03:21,125 --> 00:03:23,125
America will be ready.

57
00:03:23,208 --> 00:03:24,791
Five years.

58
00:03:24,875 --> 00:03:27,875
Well, I may play a hero
in the movies, but...

59
00:03:27,958 --> 00:03:29,875
you all are heroes in real life.

60
00:03:29,958 --> 00:03:32,375
{an8}And now you can be a hero, too.

61
00:03:32,458 --> 00:03:35,666
{an8}By purchasing a residence
in a Vault-Tec vault today.

62
00:03:35,750 --> 00:03:37,666
{an8}Because if the worst
should happen tomorrow,

63
00:03:37,750 --> 00:03:40,333
{an8}the world is gonna need
Americans just like you

64
00:03:40,416 --> 00:03:42,708
{an8}to build a better day after.

65
00:03:42,791 --> 00:03:44,583
{an8}And cut.

66
00:03:44,666 --> 00:03:47,166
That was a great take. You happy?

67
00:03:47,250 --> 00:03:48,458
Fellas, are you happy?

68
00:03:49,958 --> 00:03:51,458
All right. Gary, I'm wrapped, right?

69
00:03:51,541 --> 00:03:53,541
- Yes, sir.
- Uh, how'd we do?

70
00:03:53,625 --> 00:03:55,416
- We were so nervous.
- Aw, you did great.

71
00:03:55,500 --> 00:03:57,434
Yeah, it was really lovely to meet you.
Thanks for coming out.

72
00:03:57,458 --> 00:04:00,375
Thank you so much. Good to meet you.

73
00:04:00,458 --> 00:04:02,125
- Mr. Howard, great work today.
- Ah.

74
00:04:02,208 --> 00:04:03,416
Oh, thanks. Thanks, man.

75
00:04:03,500 --> 00:04:06,458
Bud Askins. I oversee
our Southern California operations.

76
00:04:06,541 --> 00:04:08,125
- Ah.
- I, uh, came over to Vault-Tec

77
00:04:08,208 --> 00:04:11,000
in Q3 after a ten-year stint at West Tek.

78
00:04:11,083 --> 00:04:12,375
West Tek.

79
00:04:12,458 --> 00:04:13,958
It's a defense contractor.

80
00:04:14,041 --> 00:04:16,333
Oh, I'm, uh, very familiar with you guys.

81
00:04:16,375 --> 00:04:18,125
You designed the T-45 power armor.

82
00:04:18,208 --> 00:04:19,333
First of its kind.

83
00:04:19,375 --> 00:04:21,458
No, I-I oversaw the-the rollout.

84
00:04:21,500 --> 00:04:24,375
You know, the design flaws
were ridiculous, but...

85
00:04:24,458 --> 00:04:26,416
- they sure looked great.
- I wore the T-45

86
00:04:26,500 --> 00:04:29,791
when we almost lost the great state
of Alaska to the Reds.

87
00:04:29,875 --> 00:04:33,250
Those design flaws of yours cost
a lot of good men and women their lives.

88
00:04:33,333 --> 00:04:35,583
Yeah. Product management was never my bag.

89
00:04:35,666 --> 00:04:38,375
I'm more focused on HR R&D now.

90
00:04:38,458 --> 00:04:41,750
Overseeing workflow optimization
of management timelines.

91
00:04:41,833 --> 00:04:43,041
I'm all about scale.

92
00:04:43,125 --> 00:04:46,166
Most people think scale means
increasing global market share.

93
00:04:46,250 --> 00:04:48,434
That's thinking in three dimensions,
and I'm talking about four.

94
00:04:48,458 --> 00:04:52,375
Because what is the ultimate weapon
to destroy your competition?

95
00:04:52,458 --> 00:04:54,750
It's not outselling them.
It's not outsmarting them.

96
00:04:55,833 --> 00:04:57,083
It's time.

97
00:04:57,166 --> 00:04:58,833
- Hmm.
- Time...

98
00:04:58,916 --> 00:05:00,916
- is the ultimate weapon.
- Uh-huh.

99
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:03,041
- Yeah.
- Sounds complicated,

100
00:05:03,125 --> 00:05:06,125
but the future of all humanity
comes down to one word.

101
00:05:06,208 --> 00:05:07,416
Yeah, what's that?

102
00:05:07,500 --> 00:05:09,583
Management.

103
00:05:11,916 --> 00:05:13,851
Well, I'm awful happy for you, Buck.

104
00:05:13,875 --> 00:05:16,458
Bud. Bud Askins.

105
00:05:18,125 --> 00:05:19,916
- Hey.
- Ooh!

106
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:21,541
Mmm.

107
00:05:21,625 --> 00:05:22,666
I'm at work.

108
00:05:22,750 --> 00:05:24,142
Oh, how 'bout we clock out?

109
00:05:24,166 --> 00:05:25,684
- Oh.
- Huh? Nothing against these colleagues of yours,

110
00:05:25,708 --> 00:05:29,666
but what do you say you and me knock back
a couple of piña coladas by the pool,

111
00:05:29,750 --> 00:05:31,125
- listen to the hi-fi.
- Mm.

112
00:05:31,208 --> 00:05:33,250
There is a wrap party.

113
00:05:33,333 --> 00:05:35,291
What, a... a wrap party?

114
00:05:35,375 --> 00:05:36,958
- For this?
- Yes.

115
00:05:38,541 --> 00:05:40,916
All right. We go for a couple of hours,

116
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:42,000
we shake a few hands...

117
00:05:42,083 --> 00:05:43,666
It's at our house.

118
00:05:45,250 --> 00:05:47,500
The things
I'm willing to do for you

119
00:05:47,583 --> 00:05:49,791
never cease to amaze me.

120
00:05:49,875 --> 00:05:51,000
Mm.

121
00:06:10,583 --> 00:06:13,583
Roosevelt, I'm sorry.
You can't come, buddy.

122
00:06:13,666 --> 00:06:16,000
I'm heading into enemy territory.

123
00:06:19,875 --> 00:06:21,375
You be a good dog.

124
00:06:21,458 --> 00:06:22,958
Go to bed.

125
00:06:37,083 --> 00:06:39,291
Yeah, <i>A Man and His Dog...</i>
that movie's great.

126
00:06:39,375 --> 00:06:42,416
Mm. Yeah. I love that one, too.

127
00:06:42,500 --> 00:06:44,541
It was my real dog.

128
00:06:44,625 --> 00:06:46,166
Beautiful home, Mr. Howard.

129
00:06:46,250 --> 00:06:47,375
Thank you.

130
00:06:47,458 --> 00:06:49,098
Did Cooper Howard just walk by?

131
00:06:49,166 --> 00:06:51,000
He was so good in that movie.

132
00:06:57,291 --> 00:06:59,083
Oh, it's him!

133
00:07:04,791 --> 00:07:06,791
Mr. Howard. Hello.

134
00:07:07,958 --> 00:07:11,875
Negotiations in Anchorage are having
a serious impact on presales.

135
00:07:11,958 --> 00:07:13,791
We'll have to circle up with D.C.
about that.

136
00:07:13,875 --> 00:07:16,708
Ideally before our quarterly
projection release.

137
00:07:18,083 --> 00:07:20,750
Mr. Howard. Mr. Howard.

138
00:07:22,291 --> 00:07:23,583
Bud Askins.

139
00:07:24,583 --> 00:07:25,708
Right.

140
00:07:26,708 --> 00:07:29,458
Would you mind, you know,
doing the butler voice?

141
00:07:29,541 --> 00:07:31,083
- From the show?
- All right.

142
00:07:31,166 --> 00:07:33,458
I only do it for close friends
and beautiful women,

143
00:07:33,541 --> 00:07:35,250
but you two are already halfway there.

144
00:07:35,333 --> 00:07:37,000
Stop it.

145
00:07:37,083 --> 00:07:40,875
"I, Bartholomew Codsworth,
am ever ready to serve."

146
00:07:42,375 --> 00:07:43,625
- Hoo-hoo!
- Perhaps

147
00:07:43,708 --> 00:07:46,750
when you finish your shift,
we could head up and party in the hot tub.

148
00:07:46,833 --> 00:07:47,873
What do you think of that?

149
00:07:47,916 --> 00:07:49,875
- Oh, no, no. No, thank you.
- No?

150
00:07:49,958 --> 00:07:51,291
Okay.

151
00:07:52,500 --> 00:07:53,500
All right.

152
00:07:53,583 --> 00:07:55,875
Excuse me. Your wine.

153
00:07:55,958 --> 00:07:57,375
Well, shit, Seabass.

154
00:07:57,458 --> 00:07:59,851
You might be the only one of my invites
who actually showed up.

155
00:08:02,375 --> 00:08:03,833
Yeah.

156
00:08:03,916 --> 00:08:06,017
- Not our usual scene, I'll give you that.
- No, it is not.

157
00:08:06,041 --> 00:08:08,291
I think our Hollywood actor friends
don't want to be seen

158
00:08:08,375 --> 00:08:11,000
celebrating with the pitchman
for the end of the world.

159
00:08:11,083 --> 00:08:13,375
Oh, you don't know the half of it.

160
00:08:13,458 --> 00:08:15,291
You hear I lost a movie over these ads?

161
00:08:15,375 --> 00:08:17,250
Yeah, showed up to set,

162
00:08:17,333 --> 00:08:19,375
the actors wouldn't
come out of their trailers.

163
00:08:19,458 --> 00:08:21,750
Bonnie Lewis said it was on moral grounds.

164
00:08:21,833 --> 00:08:23,125
Bonnie Lewis?

165
00:08:23,208 --> 00:08:25,375
She's done more ads
than a fucking billboard.

166
00:08:25,458 --> 00:08:27,375
- Yeah.
- Fucking Hollywood Reds.

167
00:08:27,458 --> 00:08:29,958
I'm telling you, radicalism
is sweeping through Hollywood

168
00:08:30,041 --> 00:08:32,291
like a bad case of the clap.

169
00:08:32,416 --> 00:08:34,500
Even got your friend, Charlie Whiteknife.

170
00:08:34,541 --> 00:08:36,000
Are you kidding me? Charlie?

171
00:08:36,041 --> 00:08:37,041
- Mm.
- I served

172
00:08:37,125 --> 00:08:38,476
- with that guy.
- They have meetings

173
00:08:38,500 --> 00:08:39,500
and everything.

174
00:08:39,583 --> 00:08:40,875
It's a shit show.

175
00:08:40,958 --> 00:08:42,166
But you, my friend,

176
00:08:42,250 --> 00:08:44,083
you know which way the wind is blowing.

177
00:08:44,166 --> 00:08:45,208
And it's that...

178
00:08:45,291 --> 00:08:48,333
a world run by people who wear
pocket protectors to a pool party.

179
00:08:48,416 --> 00:08:49,833
...about delivery platforms.

180
00:08:49,916 --> 00:08:51,875
Yeah, you might be right about that.

181
00:08:51,958 --> 00:08:55,083
I mean, I've dipped my bits
in the same gravy train.

182
00:08:55,166 --> 00:08:56,833
Sold my vocal rights to that

183
00:08:56,916 --> 00:09:00,541
spinning robot they sell
to housewives and perverts.

184
00:09:00,625 --> 00:09:02,250
Guess how much they paid me for that.

185
00:09:02,333 --> 00:09:03,708
Ten million?

186
00:09:08,416 --> 00:09:10,333
No, I got 186, pre-tax.

187
00:09:10,416 --> 00:09:11,684
Maybe you could've asked for more.

188
00:09:11,708 --> 00:09:12,750
Well, I did ask for more.

189
00:09:12,833 --> 00:09:13,833
And what did they say?

190
00:09:13,916 --> 00:09:15,916
My agent got them
to throw in one of those robots.

191
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:17,458
The fuck

192
00:09:17,541 --> 00:09:20,041
were they thinking?
Every time I walk into my own house,

193
00:09:20,125 --> 00:09:22,708
my own voice saying,
"Hello, sir, do you want to sit down?"

194
00:09:26,125 --> 00:09:27,333
It's fucking awful!

195
00:09:27,416 --> 00:09:28,809
I thought the studio owned that character.

196
00:09:28,833 --> 00:09:31,250
They did.
And then RobCo bought the studio.

197
00:09:31,333 --> 00:09:32,833
- Mm.
- Listen to me,

198
00:09:32,916 --> 00:09:34,833
Hollywood is the past. Forget Hollywood.

199
00:09:34,916 --> 00:09:37,666
The future, my friend, is products.

200
00:09:37,750 --> 00:09:39,416
You're a product. I'm a product.

201
00:09:39,500 --> 00:09:42,125
The end of the world is a product.

202
00:09:42,208 --> 00:09:43,375
Oh.

203
00:09:43,458 --> 00:09:47,125
And for those of us
who can successfully embrace that,

204
00:09:47,208 --> 00:09:48,666
I'd say the future is golden.

205
00:09:48,750 --> 00:09:50,458
To the future.

206
00:09:51,458 --> 00:09:52,875
To the future.

207
00:09:58,250 --> 00:10:00,583
<i>I, Bar-Bartholomew Codsworth,</i>

208
00:10:00,666 --> 00:10:02,500
<i>am ever ready to serve.</i>

209
00:10:10,333 --> 00:10:12,625
Why, hello there, boys.

210
00:10:12,708 --> 00:10:15,833
Now, y'all here for the ice cream social,

211
00:10:15,916 --> 00:10:17,625
I'm afraid I got some bad news for you.

212
00:10:18,958 --> 00:10:21,541
<i>Let's get to-to it, shall we-shall we?</i>

213
00:10:21,625 --> 00:10:22,708
<i>Wai-Wai-Waiting.</i>

214
00:10:22,791 --> 00:10:24,083
Take its fusion core.

215
00:10:24,166 --> 00:10:25,750
<i>There's no fudge here,</i>

216
00:10:25,833 --> 00:10:29,291
<i>o-only a General Atomics Inter...</i>

217
00:10:29,375 --> 00:10:33,000
Destroying a legitimate business?

218
00:10:33,083 --> 00:10:36,000
That's illegal round these parts.

219
00:10:36,083 --> 00:10:37,375
Says who?

220
00:10:38,583 --> 00:10:40,083
The government.

221
00:11:08,958 --> 00:11:11,750
Using teeth for ammunition.

222
00:11:11,833 --> 00:11:15,333
Always finding new ways
to kill each other up there, aren't they?

223
00:11:15,416 --> 00:11:17,625
We'll need, uh, an antibiotic.

224
00:11:17,708 --> 00:11:19,628
I know you mentioned
you're eager to keep moving,

225
00:11:19,708 --> 00:11:22,308
but your friend is gonna have to
recover here for a couple of days

226
00:11:22,375 --> 00:11:23,500
before it's safe to travel.

227
00:11:23,583 --> 00:11:26,208
I'm fine. I'm fine.

228
00:11:26,291 --> 00:11:29,208
You had a rotten human tooth
lodged in your shoulder.

229
00:11:29,291 --> 00:11:30,500
You're not fine.

230
00:11:30,583 --> 00:11:33,000
Titus, this is a vault doctor.

231
00:11:33,083 --> 00:11:35,625
We should listen to his advice.

232
00:11:35,708 --> 00:11:38,833
We can't thank you enough
for letting us in and taking care of us.

233
00:11:38,916 --> 00:11:40,250
It's what we do here.

234
00:11:40,333 --> 00:11:42,375
Oh, and we found his armor.

235
00:11:42,458 --> 00:11:44,750
Our surface foragers
are bringing it back now.

236
00:11:44,833 --> 00:11:46,583
Oh, that's great. Thank you.

237
00:11:46,666 --> 00:11:48,458
It's not ideal for us to stay put,

238
00:11:48,541 --> 00:11:51,916
but, I got to admit,
it sure feels good to be back in a vault.

239
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:54,916
I don't know
if you've been to the surface, but...

240
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:56,791
it is...

241
00:11:56,875 --> 00:11:57,875
not good.

242
00:11:57,958 --> 00:11:59,833
I was born on the surface.

243
00:12:01,041 --> 00:12:02,208
Oh.

244
00:12:02,291 --> 00:12:03,458
Uh, sorry.

245
00:12:03,541 --> 00:12:04,958
I-I didn't know. You seem so...

246
00:12:05,041 --> 00:12:06,166
Normal?

247
00:12:07,250 --> 00:12:08,916
My mother was a courier.

248
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:11,791
I was 11 and traveled with her to Filly.

249
00:12:12,958 --> 00:12:16,791
Three days' walk from home and we
could still feel the heat from the blast.

250
00:12:17,875 --> 00:12:19,041
You're from Shady Sands.

251
00:12:19,125 --> 00:12:20,250
Many of us are.

252
00:12:20,333 --> 00:12:23,375
We were lucky to find such
a hospitable community here in Vault 4.

253
00:12:23,458 --> 00:12:26,583
Yeah. So were we.

254
00:12:26,666 --> 00:12:28,809
We just need you to stay
in quarantine a few hours longer

255
00:12:28,833 --> 00:12:31,291
to make sure
you don't track in any contamination.

256
00:12:33,083 --> 00:12:34,833
Thank you so much.

257
00:12:55,250 --> 00:12:56,708
You smell good.

258
00:12:58,041 --> 00:13:00,041
What?

259
00:13:03,750 --> 00:13:05,250
Oh.

260
00:13:08,375 --> 00:13:10,000
You want to have sex?

261
00:13:12,708 --> 00:13:14,625
You mean use my cock?

262
00:13:15,708 --> 00:13:17,166
Yeah.

263
00:13:19,708 --> 00:13:23,625
I don't know.
Uh, that weird thing could happen.

264
00:13:23,708 --> 00:13:25,750
What weird thing?

265
00:13:25,833 --> 00:13:28,083
Well, it's just, for some guys... not me...

266
00:13:28,166 --> 00:13:31,833
uh, but for some guys, you know,
when they make it move,

267
00:13:31,916 --> 00:13:35,583
it gets all big and hard
like a big pimple and then it pops.

268
00:13:35,666 --> 00:13:39,500
And they say it can happen
to anybody, but it's still, it's...

269
00:13:39,583 --> 00:13:41,541
it's gross.

270
00:13:41,625 --> 00:13:44,208
You know, that's... uh,
that's actually completely normal.

271
00:13:44,291 --> 00:13:46,333
It happens all the time.

272
00:13:46,416 --> 00:13:48,666
Every time, ideally.

273
00:13:56,500 --> 00:13:58,041
I'm a knight.

274
00:13:58,125 --> 00:14:01,208
Um, a knight of the Brotherhood.

275
00:14:02,875 --> 00:14:04,625
We're-we're not supposed to.

276
00:14:06,791 --> 00:14:07,958
Okey dokey.

277
00:14:31,041 --> 00:14:32,125
Mind if I sit down?

278
00:14:41,750 --> 00:14:43,166
Mmm.

279
00:14:43,250 --> 00:14:45,333
We shouldn't be wasting time down here.

280
00:14:45,416 --> 00:14:47,666
You heard the doctor.

281
00:14:47,750 --> 00:14:50,625
Besides, we made a deal
to find that head together,

282
00:14:50,708 --> 00:14:52,708
and you're no good to me dead.

283
00:14:53,875 --> 00:14:57,291
- Also, I would feel bad.
- I think these people are trying to trap us here.

284
00:14:57,375 --> 00:14:58,791
No, they're not.

285
00:14:58,875 --> 00:15:02,000
And some of these people
are from the surface, like you.

286
00:15:04,833 --> 00:15:07,708
- Ah.
- Hi.

287
00:15:07,791 --> 00:15:11,083
This is a cult. Same as any.

288
00:15:11,166 --> 00:15:12,166
It's not a cult.

289
00:15:12,250 --> 00:15:15,916
- Everyone's smiling.
- Titus, this is a safe place,

290
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:18,583
where people take care of each other.

291
00:15:19,666 --> 00:15:20,916
But why?

292
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:22,416
Well, because in the vaults,

293
00:15:22,500 --> 00:15:25,000
we recognize that
we all need each other,

294
00:15:25,083 --> 00:15:27,333
just like I needed you on the surface.

295
00:15:30,083 --> 00:15:32,541
Now, we're stuck here
until you're able to travel.

296
00:15:32,625 --> 00:15:35,583
So, give this place a shot?

297
00:15:38,416 --> 00:15:41,208
Sorry to interrupt your breakfast,
but our overseer

298
00:15:41,291 --> 00:15:43,666
wanted to say a quick hello.

299
00:15:44,750 --> 00:15:46,958
Overseer Benjamin, this is Lucy and Titus.

300
00:15:47,041 --> 00:15:50,291
Hey, guys. Just wanted to say hi.

301
00:15:50,375 --> 00:15:54,375
- Hello.
- And obviously, welcome to Vault 4.

302
00:15:54,458 --> 00:15:56,791
Just some housekeeping,
a few things to be aware of.

303
00:15:56,875 --> 00:15:59,250
Stay out of Level 12, obviously.

304
00:15:59,333 --> 00:16:01,416
We'd prefer you not go there.

305
00:16:01,500 --> 00:16:05,250
Oh, and we only have one foosball table,
so if you want to play,

306
00:16:05,333 --> 00:16:06,916
you got to sign up.

307
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:10,250
If there's no pencil on the sign-up sheet,
please let me know.

308
00:16:10,333 --> 00:16:13,416
I do have pencils.

309
00:16:13,500 --> 00:16:17,708
Uh, oh, and if you're unfamiliar
with how the bathrooms work, just ask.

310
00:16:17,791 --> 00:16:21,666
Asking is less embarrassing
than getting it wrong. Trust me.

311
00:16:21,750 --> 00:16:25,125
We've had incident after incident
with newcomers.

312
00:16:25,208 --> 00:16:28,041
Okay, that should cover it.

313
00:16:28,125 --> 00:16:32,208
Any questions or concerns beyond foosball
or pencils or bathrooms,

314
00:16:32,291 --> 00:16:33,833
Birdie's available.

315
00:16:33,916 --> 00:16:36,625
And once again, welcome to Vault 4.

316
00:16:36,708 --> 00:16:38,500
We're glad to have you.

317
00:16:38,583 --> 00:16:41,250
- Thank you.
- Mm.

318
00:16:55,166 --> 00:16:56,916
Mm.

319
00:17:07,625 --> 00:17:10,291
That was weird, right?

320
00:17:10,375 --> 00:17:13,000
- The overseer?
- That's what I'm saying.

321
00:17:13,083 --> 00:17:14,283
- When people are nice...
- No.

322
00:17:14,333 --> 00:17:17,375
Titus, I'm... I'm talking about his eye.

323
00:17:17,458 --> 00:17:18,958
Lots of people have one eye.

324
00:17:19,041 --> 00:17:22,000
Well, yeah, but...

325
00:17:22,083 --> 00:17:24,041
I mean, his was in the middle.

326
00:17:24,125 --> 00:17:25,250
A little to the left.

327
00:17:25,333 --> 00:17:27,416
And the Level 12 stuff? I mean...

328
00:17:30,666 --> 00:17:32,458
Oh.

329
00:17:34,833 --> 00:17:36,625
Sorry.

330
00:17:36,708 --> 00:17:38,583
Have a nice day.

331
00:17:48,291 --> 00:17:52,750
<i>♪ Lonely hours ♪</i>

332
00:17:52,833 --> 00:17:57,166
<i>♪ Away from you...</i>

333
00:17:58,416 --> 00:18:01,083
Doesn't get any better than this.

334
00:18:01,166 --> 00:18:04,125
Nope. It does not.

335
00:18:04,208 --> 00:18:05,291
Mmm.

336
00:18:07,958 --> 00:18:11,958
You ever... think about working
somewhere else?

337
00:18:13,416 --> 00:18:15,416
I used to.

338
00:18:15,500 --> 00:18:20,791
But with you doing these ads, it's...
it's practically the family business.

339
00:18:20,875 --> 00:18:22,500
Maybe we get Janey a job in payroll

340
00:18:22,583 --> 00:18:24,166
- when she's 15.
- Sit.

341
00:18:24,250 --> 00:18:26,250
Oh, that's a good puppy.

342
00:18:26,333 --> 00:18:29,458
I think about it. Quitting showbiz.

343
00:18:31,291 --> 00:18:34,875
Buying us a ranch up in Bakersfield.

344
00:18:35,875 --> 00:18:38,375
Get back to being a real cowboy again.

345
00:18:38,458 --> 00:18:40,208
And what would I do?

346
00:18:40,291 --> 00:18:42,791
You would look pretty.

347
00:18:42,875 --> 00:18:45,333
And help me raise chickens.

348
00:18:45,416 --> 00:18:48,333
No.

349
00:18:48,416 --> 00:18:50,375
You would look very good
in a pair of overalls.

350
00:18:50,458 --> 00:18:52,208
What's gotten into you?

351
00:18:52,291 --> 00:18:53,875
A gin martini.

352
00:18:55,625 --> 00:18:57,541
I don't know.

353
00:18:57,625 --> 00:19:01,583
Maybe I've been reading
too much news lately.

354
00:19:01,666 --> 00:19:05,500
Got me second-guessing
the whole city life.

355
00:19:13,791 --> 00:19:15,000
Oh, come on.

356
00:19:15,083 --> 00:19:16,666
Y-You've seen these around.

357
00:19:16,750 --> 00:19:18,083
Not on you, I haven't.

358
00:19:18,166 --> 00:19:20,875
Bud Askins... he licensed them from RobCo.

359
00:19:20,958 --> 00:19:23,458
We're integrating them
with the Vault-Tec admission systems.

360
00:19:23,541 --> 00:19:26,791
- Bud Askins.
- Bud Askins. Trust me, I know.

361
00:19:26,875 --> 00:19:29,041
The company's filled with guys like him.

362
00:19:29,125 --> 00:19:32,500
But Vault-Tec exists with or without me.

363
00:19:32,583 --> 00:19:35,416
Doesn't do anyone any good
to complain from the sidelines.

364
00:19:35,500 --> 00:19:37,958
All I'm saying is we have this one life.

365
00:19:38,041 --> 00:19:42,250
Do you really want to spend your
nine-to-fives working with these assholes?

366
00:19:42,333 --> 00:19:44,250
I need this job, Coop.

367
00:19:44,333 --> 00:19:46,875
- It guarantees us a spot in the vaults.
- We got money.

368
00:19:46,958 --> 00:19:48,375
We can buy a spot in the vaults.

369
00:19:48,458 --> 00:19:50,250
One of the good vaults.

370
00:19:51,791 --> 00:19:53,833
What's that supposed to mean?

371
00:20:01,125 --> 00:20:04,333
I'm doing what I can, okay?

372
00:20:04,416 --> 00:20:07,458
Just... trust me.

373
00:20:09,458 --> 00:20:11,166
Please.

374
00:20:12,875 --> 00:20:14,541
Yeah.

375
00:20:22,166 --> 00:20:23,666
<i>As all nations race</i>

376
00:20:23,750 --> 00:20:26,250

377
00:20:26,333 --> 00:20:29,083
<i>a shortage has emerged,

378
00:20:29,166 --> 00:20:31,375

380
00:20:33,791 --> 00:20:36,072
<i>and will it lead to an expanded war?</i>

<i>Details after a word

382
00:20:38,166 --> 00:20:41,208
Sorry you couldn't make it
to the party the other night, Charlie.

383
00:20:42,250 --> 00:20:44,625
Guess you had one of your meetings, huh?

384
00:20:44,708 --> 00:20:47,250
One of your Communist meetings?
Come on, man.

385
00:20:47,333 --> 00:20:50,625
We watched people die together up north
fighting against all that horseshit.

386
00:20:50,708 --> 00:20:52,041
Yeah, and for what?

387
00:20:52,125 --> 00:20:55,666
What do you mean, for what?
For the American dream.

388
00:20:55,750 --> 00:20:58,875
We're actors.
We make movies, Charlie.

389
00:20:58,958 --> 00:21:01,059
Yeah, the American dream has me
getting shot in the ass by you all day.

390
00:21:01,083 --> 00:21:04,000
You got five acres in Tarzana.
I think you're doing all right.

391
00:21:04,083 --> 00:21:05,750
It don't matter, Coop.

392
00:21:05,833 --> 00:21:10,083
- Vault-Tec's the fucking devil, man.
- My wife works there.

393
00:21:10,166 --> 00:21:13,500
- You really think Barb's the devil?
- No, no, okay, I...

394
00:21:13,583 --> 00:21:15,375
I like Barb, okay?

395
00:21:17,666 --> 00:21:19,626
Do you know what
"fiduciary responsibility" means?

396
00:21:19,708 --> 00:21:21,083
- Fiduciary responsibility?
- Yeah.

397
00:21:21,166 --> 00:21:23,833
No, I have no fucking idea.

398
00:21:23,916 --> 00:21:25,708
I play a cowboy for a living.

399
00:21:25,791 --> 00:21:28,541
Okay.
So, the U.S. government has outsourced

400
00:21:28,625 --> 00:21:30,791
the survival of the human race
to Vault-Tec.

401
00:21:30,875 --> 00:21:33,583
Vault-Tec is a private corporation

402
00:21:33,666 --> 00:21:36,309
that has a fiduciary responsibility
to make money for its investors.

403
00:21:36,333 --> 00:21:38,791
And how does it make money?

404
00:21:39,958 --> 00:21:42,291
- By selling vaults.
- That's called capitalism, Charlie.

405
00:21:42,375 --> 00:21:45,333
But they can't sell vaults
if these peace negotiations go through.

406
00:21:45,416 --> 00:21:48,958
So Vault-Tec
has a fiduciary responsibility

407
00:21:49,041 --> 00:21:51,208
to make sure that it don't work out.

408
00:21:51,291 --> 00:21:54,166
Yeah. How they gonna do that?

409
00:21:54,250 --> 00:21:55,916
I don't know.

410
00:21:58,333 --> 00:22:00,500
You remember that movie
we did with Johnny Morton...

411
00:22:00,583 --> 00:22:03,041
you were the sheriff
and I was some generic Indian?

412
00:22:03,125 --> 00:22:05,916
Come on, man, don't say that.
Tallhand Mudlake could talk to horses.

413
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:08,000
You played him with grace
and with dignity.

414
00:22:08,083 --> 00:22:09,875
It was a great role for you.

415
00:22:09,958 --> 00:22:11,601
Morton played a rancher
who owned half of Missouri.

416
00:22:11,625 --> 00:22:14,351
And what happens when the cattle ranchers
have more power than the sheriff?

417
00:22:14,375 --> 00:22:17,625
- The whole town burns down.
- The whole town burns down. Right.

418
00:22:17,708 --> 00:22:20,184
Vault-Tec is a trillion dollar company
that owns half of everything.

419
00:22:20,208 --> 00:22:23,291
And after ten years of war,
the U.S. government is broker than a joke.

420
00:22:23,375 --> 00:22:25,708
The cattle ranchers are in charge, Coop.

421
00:22:25,791 --> 00:22:27,458
Oh, come on.

422
00:22:27,541 --> 00:22:29,791
Unless the people do something about it.

423
00:22:29,875 --> 00:22:31,958
I guess everything's a conspiracy, right?

424
00:22:32,041 --> 00:22:34,267
- Come on, man, you sound like you're in a cult.
- And you're sitting here

425
00:22:34,291 --> 00:22:36,517
defending a system that's ready
to set the world on fire, Cooper.

426
00:22:36,541 --> 00:22:39,041
Maybe you're the one in the cult.

427
00:22:43,166 --> 00:22:45,000
Look.

428
00:22:45,083 --> 00:22:47,000
You should come to a meeting.

429
00:22:47,083 --> 00:22:49,583
You should learn the truth
about where your wife works.

430
00:22:52,791 --> 00:22:54,458
For her sake.

431
00:23:06,750 --> 00:23:08,583
Bartender, can I get one more?

432
00:23:17,916 --> 00:23:22,041
- Hello?
<i>- Hello! May I speak to Barb, please?</i>

433
00:23:22,125 --> 00:23:23,791
- Who is it?
<i>- It's Henry.</i>

434
00:23:23,875 --> 00:23:26,208
<i>Henry from the Vault-Tec
assistant training program.</i>

435
00:23:26,291 --> 00:23:27,958
<i>Is this Mr. Cooper Howard?</i>

436
00:23:28,041 --> 00:23:31,500
Uh, I'm sorry, Henry, but my wife prefers
not to take work calls in the evenings.

437
00:23:31,583 --> 00:23:32,892
<i>Oh, no, no, no, uh,
it'll just be a few minutes.</i>

438
00:23:32,916 --> 00:23:34,476
- Okay. All right, bye-bye.
<i>- I have some questions for her. I don't...</i>

439
00:23:34,500 --> 00:23:38,375
Uh, that was Henry. From work.

440
00:23:38,458 --> 00:23:40,833
Do you have a... a new assistant?

441
00:23:40,916 --> 00:23:42,000
Yeah, I do.

442
00:23:42,083 --> 00:23:44,708
Yeah? Is Janey asleep?

443
00:23:44,791 --> 00:23:47,250
Uh, she's reading
<i>Little House on the Prairie</i> to Roosevelt.

444
00:23:47,333 --> 00:23:49,708
Ah. Does he like it?

445
00:23:54,291 --> 00:23:55,375
What?

446
00:23:56,458 --> 00:23:58,708
It's going to be hard on her, that's all.

447
00:24:00,291 --> 00:24:01,791
What is?

448
00:24:01,875 --> 00:24:04,291
You know, no dogs in the vaults.

449
00:24:12,208 --> 00:24:14,458
Says who?

450
00:24:14,541 --> 00:24:16,125
Hmm?

451
00:24:18,041 --> 00:24:20,791
No dogs in the vaults. Says who?

452
00:24:21,875 --> 00:24:24,375
Well... that's just

453
00:24:24,458 --> 00:24:26,833
the, um... that's the policy.

454
00:24:27,916 --> 00:24:29,291
You know, dogs eat meat.

455
00:24:30,375 --> 00:24:31,958
It's an avoidable inefficiency.

456
00:24:32,041 --> 00:24:33,958
Ah.

457
00:24:34,041 --> 00:24:35,458
Yeah.

458
00:24:39,375 --> 00:24:41,666
That's not really the question, is it?

459
00:24:41,750 --> 00:24:44,583
All I'm asking is

460
00:24:44,666 --> 00:24:47,083
who decided that
there were no dogs in the vault?

461
00:24:47,166 --> 00:24:50,791
Well, I think that
is a relatively trivial concern,

462
00:24:50,875 --> 00:24:53,291
given the prerequisite conditions
of us living in

463
00:24:53,375 --> 00:24:54,750
a nuclear fallout shelter.

464
00:24:54,833 --> 00:24:58,375
Well, you know, I'm not sure that it is,
to be quite honest.

465
00:24:58,458 --> 00:24:59,875
What?

466
00:24:59,958 --> 00:25:01,416
I'm serious.

467
00:25:01,500 --> 00:25:04,125
Who-who ma... who makes the rules?

468
00:25:04,208 --> 00:25:06,625
Because no dogs allowed...
that is a new rule.

469
00:25:06,708 --> 00:25:10,541
Somebody decided that
and didn't share it with fucking anyone.

470
00:25:12,375 --> 00:25:13,767
I mean, what else
do you have in store for us?

471
00:25:13,791 --> 00:25:15,875
Are the-are the blue jumpsuits...

472
00:25:15,958 --> 00:25:17,934
are those mandatory? What if
I don't want to wear a blue jumpsuit?

473
00:25:17,958 --> 00:25:19,726
- What if I want to wear a green one?
- So the bomb falls,

474
00:25:19,750 --> 00:25:21,226
and you want to know about your wardrobe?

475
00:25:21,250 --> 00:25:23,166
No, I want to know about my freedom.

476
00:25:23,250 --> 00:25:25,708
I didn't go to war defending that freedom

477
00:25:25,791 --> 00:25:27,642
so that I could live in a cellar
under the boot heel

478
00:25:27,666 --> 00:25:29,208
of Chairman Bud Askins.

479
00:25:29,291 --> 00:25:33,250
And while you were away at war,
I stayed home.

480
00:25:33,333 --> 00:25:35,500
- I know you...
- I was checking the mail

481
00:25:35,583 --> 00:25:36,916
- every day.
- I know.

482
00:25:37,000 --> 00:25:38,791
I was waiting by the phone every night.

483
00:25:38,875 --> 00:25:41,833
And every night I was driving myself crazy

484
00:25:41,916 --> 00:25:43,000
imagining the worst.

485
00:25:43,083 --> 00:25:47,000
So, you do not need to tell me
how bad war is, Coop.

486
00:25:47,083 --> 00:25:49,500
Every day I go into work and I think about

487
00:25:49,583 --> 00:25:52,875
how humanity can survive a nuclear event

488
00:25:52,958 --> 00:25:56,166
that will wipe out 90% of life on earth
and I come home

489
00:25:56,250 --> 00:25:59,625
and you're talking to me about
hiding out at a ranch up in Bakersfield.

490
00:26:00,666 --> 00:26:03,708
You know, I don't even know
what planet you're on sometimes, Coop.

491
00:26:03,791 --> 00:26:07,250
But when the bombs drop,
a two-hour drive ain't gonna cut it.

492
00:26:07,333 --> 00:26:10,666
So yes, there will be no dogs
in the vaults.

493
00:26:10,750 --> 00:26:13,125
And no, none of it is ideal.

494
00:26:13,208 --> 00:26:16,916
But if billions of people
are going to lose their lives,

495
00:26:17,000 --> 00:26:19,142
I will do whatever it takes
to make sure the people I love...

496
00:26:19,166 --> 00:26:21,291
that is you and that is Janey...

497
00:26:21,375 --> 00:26:23,000
aren't among them.

498
00:26:25,208 --> 00:26:27,875
I have worked hard

499
00:26:27,958 --> 00:26:30,583
to make sure we go into

500
00:26:30,666 --> 00:26:32,583
a special vault for management,

501
00:26:32,666 --> 00:26:36,166
where we will oversee
all of the other vaults.

502
00:26:38,208 --> 00:26:42,125
You don't get it.
That is the best we can possibly hope for.

503
00:26:43,166 --> 00:26:45,083
For Janey.

504
00:26:52,541 --> 00:26:54,000
Hey, hey.

505
00:26:54,083 --> 00:26:56,250
Hey, hey, hey.

506
00:26:56,333 --> 00:26:58,250
Come here.

507
00:27:00,833 --> 00:27:02,375
I'm sorry.

508
00:27:02,458 --> 00:27:05,791
I know you always
try to do the right thing.

509
00:27:07,583 --> 00:27:09,458
That's what I love about you.

510
00:27:24,375 --> 00:27:28,750
And when you turn the little handle
up top, it all goes away.

511
00:27:28,833 --> 00:27:30,666
Yep, that's...

512
00:27:30,750 --> 00:27:33,000
- how a toilet works.
- Mm-hmm.

513
00:27:33,083 --> 00:27:34,916
I'm-I'm actually from a vault.

514
00:27:35,000 --> 00:27:36,291
You're what?

515
00:27:36,375 --> 00:27:39,666
- I'm from a vault.
- So you are.

516
00:27:39,750 --> 00:27:43,666
- Goosey MacLean.
- Oh, no, no. It's-it's Lucy.

517
00:27:47,958 --> 00:27:51,625
Nope, it says Goosey. Hmm.

518
00:27:51,708 --> 00:27:53,666
But hey, that's something.

519
00:27:53,750 --> 00:27:56,750
You don't meet a natural-born
vault dweller every day.

520
00:27:56,833 --> 00:27:58,000
We're a dying breed.

521
00:27:58,083 --> 00:28:00,666
Oh, you're... you're from here?

522
00:28:00,750 --> 00:28:03,500
- Five generations, and proud of it.
- Ah.

523
00:28:03,583 --> 00:28:04,958
I just thought because...

524
00:28:06,875 --> 00:28:11,375
Because so many, uh, people here
seem to be refugees

525
00:28:11,458 --> 00:28:13,750
- from the surface.
- Tell me about it.

526
00:28:13,833 --> 00:28:15,625
Ooh. These people.

527
00:28:15,708 --> 00:28:17,000
Am I right?

528
00:28:19,125 --> 00:28:20,958
I grabbed a moldy one.

529
00:28:21,041 --> 00:28:22,401
- What do you mean by that?
- Well,

530
00:28:22,458 --> 00:28:25,125
you won't find anyone
more open-minded than me,

531
00:28:25,208 --> 00:28:28,791
but they come in here
with their smelly food

532
00:28:28,875 --> 00:28:30,875
and their weird ideas.

533
00:28:32,416 --> 00:28:34,333
You're from a vault. You get it.

534
00:28:34,416 --> 00:28:36,642
I-I don't understand.
If you don't like people from the surface

535
00:28:36,666 --> 00:28:38,059
then why do you keep taking them in?

536
00:28:38,083 --> 00:28:40,375
It's a policy from before my time.

537
00:28:40,458 --> 00:28:42,500
But these newcomers, ooh, let me tell you,

538
00:28:42,583 --> 00:28:45,833
if you want to get elected,
you have to respect their traditions

539
00:28:45,916 --> 00:28:49,583
and tolerate them
and not call them "surfies." It's awful.

540
00:28:50,666 --> 00:28:54,000
What, you don't
take in surface dwellers in your vault?

541
00:28:54,083 --> 00:28:57,208
Well, to be honest, no, we don't.

542
00:28:57,291 --> 00:28:59,416
- What is that like?
- No,

543
00:28:59,500 --> 00:29:01,142
I think what you're doing here
is a really good thing.

544
00:29:01,166 --> 00:29:03,541
I saw what was left of Shady Sands.

545
00:29:03,625 --> 00:29:07,291
An entire city just destroyed
in an instant. It...

546
00:29:09,208 --> 00:29:10,934
I mean, some of these people
lost everything.

547
00:29:10,958 --> 00:29:13,458
And that was a tragedy.

548
00:29:13,541 --> 00:29:16,791
So we took our share of them in
and gave them a home

549
00:29:16,875 --> 00:29:18,375
because it's what we do.

550
00:29:18,458 --> 00:29:20,666
But it's like you can't
make a funny joke about it

551
00:29:20,750 --> 00:29:22,000
without offending these guys.

552
00:29:22,083 --> 00:29:25,250
I mean, one funny joke I told
on maybe ten occasions.

553
00:29:25,333 --> 00:29:27,583
What was the joke?

554
00:29:27,666 --> 00:29:28,666
I forget.

555
00:29:28,750 --> 00:29:31,375
All I know is it was a huge bomb.

556
00:29:32,375 --> 00:29:35,041
Pretty good, right?

557
00:29:35,125 --> 00:29:37,541
Oh, she doesn't get it.

558
00:29:37,625 --> 00:29:38,916
Any other questions?

559
00:29:39,000 --> 00:29:41,625
I do have one. Uh...

560
00:29:41,708 --> 00:29:44,791
What's on Level 12
and why can't we go there?

561
00:29:44,875 --> 00:29:46,375
We don't talk about that.

562
00:29:46,458 --> 00:29:48,378
- Geez, what's the matter with you?
- Sorry, I...

563
00:29:48,416 --> 00:29:49,916
- I just...
- You should go now.

564
00:29:50,000 --> 00:29:52,333
- I only wanted to...
- Goodbye, Goosey.

565
00:29:59,250 --> 00:30:01,208
Skedaddle.

566
00:30:47,500 --> 00:30:48,500
Hey.

567
00:30:53,166 --> 00:30:55,125
Where do you guys get your power from?

568
00:31:43,875 --> 00:31:46,208
I see you found our fusion core.

569
00:31:50,666 --> 00:31:53,041
How are we adjusting to life down here?

570
00:31:53,125 --> 00:31:55,083
Does it matter?

571
00:31:55,166 --> 00:31:56,625
I'm leaving soon.

572
00:32:00,541 --> 00:32:01,958
Aren't I?

573
00:32:04,083 --> 00:32:06,541
Some people who come here
have a hard time adjusting

574
00:32:06,625 --> 00:32:08,958
to finally feeling safe.

575
00:32:10,208 --> 00:32:13,750
All the things you've had to do to survive
still fresh in your mind.

576
00:32:17,583 --> 00:32:21,083
Trust doesn't come easily to those of us
with a guilty conscience.

577
00:32:26,333 --> 00:32:27,458
Here.

578
00:32:27,541 --> 00:32:29,458
Unit 428.

579
00:32:29,541 --> 00:32:32,541
How about you sleep in a room
of your own tonight?

580
00:32:32,625 --> 00:32:34,875
Have a hot shower.

581
00:32:34,958 --> 00:32:37,708
Nothing wrong with
a little bit of comfort.

582
00:32:45,583 --> 00:32:49,166
Um, when you say "hot shower,"
what does-what does that mean, exactly?

583
00:33:56,208 --> 00:33:58,625

00:35:28,875 --> 00:35:30,333
Excuse me.

608
00:35:30,416 --> 00:35:32,416
Yes.

609
00:35:38,375 --> 00:35:39,875
What is this?

610
00:37:03,250 --> 00:37:05,017
It's almost starting.

611
00:37:23,583 --> 00:37:24,625
Oh, uh, excuse me?

612
00:37:24,708 --> 00:37:26,166
What's going on?

613
00:37:26,250 --> 00:37:27,875
It's a Surface Dweller tradition.

614
00:37:27,958 --> 00:37:30,250
It can get a little rambunctious
for my taste.

615
00:37:33,791 --> 00:37:36,000
You're welcome to come.

616
00:37:37,500 --> 00:37:39,166
Sure.

617
00:38:04,833 --> 00:38:06,541
Well, shit.

618
00:38:07,791 --> 00:38:09,875
Why, Sorrel Booker.

619
00:38:13,125 --> 00:38:17,541
I heard it was a ghoul
that fucked up that Super Duper Mart.

620
00:38:17,625 --> 00:38:19,625
Nobody told me it was the ghoul.

621
00:38:19,708 --> 00:38:21,541
Mm. Mm.

622
00:38:23,208 --> 00:38:24,958
You boys know who you just brought in?

623
00:38:26,166 --> 00:38:27,666
This sumbitch right here

624
00:38:27,750 --> 00:38:31,166
used to be the best bounty hunter
to ever shoot a man in the ass.

625
00:38:31,250 --> 00:38:34,625
Kids these days don't know
their goddamn history.

626
00:38:34,708 --> 00:38:36,583
Say, you got a needle and thread?

627
00:38:36,666 --> 00:38:39,041
Sorry,

628
00:38:39,125 --> 00:38:41,291
we don't do a lot of knitting 'round here.

629
00:38:41,375 --> 00:38:43,750
It's called sewing.

630
00:38:43,833 --> 00:38:45,833
I think I got some in my bag.

631
00:39:05,166 --> 00:39:07,208
Would you mind?

632
00:39:08,833 --> 00:39:12,250
Aw, come on now, Sorrel,
we old friends, ain't we?

633
00:39:20,583 --> 00:39:23,500
Look at you. 200 years.

634
00:39:24,625 --> 00:39:27,291
I don't know what keeps you going.

635
00:39:27,375 --> 00:39:29,750
Maybe you just like the feeling

636
00:39:29,833 --> 00:39:32,458
of that good old California sunshine

637
00:39:32,541 --> 00:39:35,166
on your wrinkly-ass face.

638
00:39:37,250 --> 00:39:40,625
Or maybe you're still looking for her.

639
00:39:43,500 --> 00:39:44,666
Well, Sorrel...

640
00:39:46,375 --> 00:39:49,083
I can confidently cross
one reason off that list for you.

641
00:39:49,166 --> 00:39:51,583
I sure as hell ain't still alive

642
00:39:51,666 --> 00:39:53,875
so that I can have
unintelligent conversations

643
00:39:53,958 --> 00:39:55,875
with dipshits like yourself.

644
00:39:58,333 --> 00:40:00,500
Mind your fucking mouth.

645
00:40:00,583 --> 00:40:03,166
That's the president of the government
you're talking to.

646
00:40:06,708 --> 00:40:08,125
Oh...

647
00:40:09,875 --> 00:40:11,916
You a president now?

648
00:40:12,000 --> 00:40:13,833
Don't see why not.

649
00:40:13,916 --> 00:40:16,541
Well, then you might
want to hire a publicist.

650
00:40:16,625 --> 00:40:19,000
'Cause this is the first
I'm hearing about this outfit.

651
00:40:19,083 --> 00:40:22,500
Now, what I am hearing
is a whole lot of chatter

652
00:40:22,583 --> 00:40:24,166
about some woman.

653
00:40:24,250 --> 00:40:25,833
Name of Moldaver.

654
00:40:30,541 --> 00:40:32,333
They call her the Flame Mother.

655
00:40:33,458 --> 00:40:35,083
Now, that bitch is dangerous.

656
00:40:35,166 --> 00:40:37,708
Well, when it comes to leadership
these days,

657
00:40:37,791 --> 00:40:40,625
dangerous is what they call
a prerequisite.

658
00:40:40,708 --> 00:40:43,375
Somebody's got to step up
and bring some order around here.

659
00:40:43,458 --> 00:40:46,125
You know why these boys brought you in?

660
00:40:46,208 --> 00:40:47,541
'Cause I fucked up

661
00:40:47,625 --> 00:40:50,250
a poor, defenseless
gang-affiliated organ dealership?

662
00:40:50,333 --> 00:40:52,000
- Yep.
- Mm.

663
00:40:52,083 --> 00:40:54,916
- Now, I've always liked you.
- Well, I've always liked you.

664
00:40:55,000 --> 00:40:58,625
Well, ain't that sweet?
But that Super Duper Mart you gutted

665
00:40:58,708 --> 00:41:00,208
was under our protection.

666
00:41:01,333 --> 00:41:04,958
So, if I wanted to let you go scot-free,

667
00:41:05,041 --> 00:41:07,833
folks might lose faith
about what we're trying to do here.

668
00:41:07,916 --> 00:41:09,083
And then what?

669
00:41:10,500 --> 00:41:12,333
Anarchy in the streets.

670
00:41:12,416 --> 00:41:14,750
Exactly.

671
00:41:14,833 --> 00:41:17,666
Now, you got anything to say
in your defense?

672
00:41:17,750 --> 00:41:19,333
Guilty as charged.

673
00:41:19,416 --> 00:41:20,958
Just like that?

674
00:41:22,375 --> 00:41:25,583
Just like that.

675
00:41:25,666 --> 00:41:27,833
Now, if you need any more evidence,

676
00:41:27,916 --> 00:41:31,541
I can tell you about this town
I just shot up, Filly.

677
00:41:31,625 --> 00:41:35,083
Oh, I must have killed nine or ten people.

678
00:41:35,166 --> 00:41:36,833
My daddy lives in Filly.

679
00:41:36,916 --> 00:41:39,291
Well, not no more he don't,

680
00:41:39,375 --> 00:41:41,000
unless he's a coward.

681
00:41:41,083 --> 00:41:43,541
Don't take the bait, son.

682
00:41:43,625 --> 00:41:47,166
Well, I ain't fishing.
I'm just trying to game this out, now.

683
00:41:47,250 --> 00:41:51,166
In my experience, the apple
tends not to fall too far from the tree.

684
00:41:52,916 --> 00:41:55,166
Is that true in your case?

685
00:41:55,250 --> 00:41:57,583
My daddy ain't no coward.

686
00:41:57,666 --> 00:42:01,000
Well, then I guess the only question is...

687
00:42:02,208 --> 00:42:03,833
...are you?

688
00:42:05,541 --> 00:42:06,791
Sheriff Rex.

689
00:42:07,875 --> 00:42:10,000
Take Sheriff Troy's guns away.

690
00:42:13,416 --> 00:42:15,708
Very presidential of you.

691
00:42:17,250 --> 00:42:19,583
Take him out back
and feed him to the hogs.

692
00:42:40,458 --> 00:42:42,041
Goddamn it.

693
00:42:43,291 --> 00:42:45,791
I got one question for you, ol' buddy.

694
00:42:45,875 --> 00:42:48,416
Why...

695
00:42:51,375 --> 00:42:54,375
do you have this picture on your wall?

696
00:42:54,458 --> 00:42:56,583
That's Moldaver.

697
00:42:58,166 --> 00:42:59,916
Why?

698
00:43:01,708 --> 00:43:03,958
Well, that's not
how I remember her, is all.

699
00:43:05,250 --> 00:43:06,750
Yeah?

700
00:43:06,833 --> 00:43:09,708
Well, how do you remember her?

Thanks for coming.

704

Yeah, we'll see if I stay.

You'll stay.

We bring back those taken from us.

719
00:46:43,166 --> 00:46:45,750

To bring back Shady Sands,
blood must spill.

725
00:46:58,375 --> 00:46:59,767
I think there's somebody you should meet.

726
00:46:59,791 --> 00:47:01,434
- Yeah, who's that?
<i>- Blood must spill.</i>

727
00:47:01,458 --> 00:47:04,500

Oh, Flame Mother, you will be
our salvation.

734
00:47:25,875 --> 00:47:27,291
Mr. Howard?

735
00:47:32,541 --> 00:47:34,541
Oh, Flame Mother,

736
00:47:34,625 --> 00:47:36,875
you will be our salvation.

737
00:47:37,958 --> 00:47:39,083
I'm a big fan.

738
00:48:04,083 --> 00:48:05,291
Titus?!

739
00:48:07,750 --> 00:48:09,291
We need to talk...

740
00:48:10,291 --> 00:48:11,916
Yes.

741
00:48:14,458 --> 00:48:15,791
You were right about this place.

742
00:48:15,875 --> 00:48:16,875
No.

743
00:48:16,958 --> 00:48:20,708
You were right. Check this out.
These are called oysters.

744
00:48:20,791 --> 00:48:23,708
You want one?
They make you feel so good.

745
00:48:23,791 --> 00:48:25,958
You want to make my cock explode now?

746
00:48:26,041 --> 00:48:28,541
- What?
- Sorry, intercourse?

747
00:48:28,625 --> 00:48:30,291
No, Titus.

748
00:48:30,375 --> 00:48:32,916
No, we need to leave. Right now.

749
00:48:33,000 --> 00:48:34,625
These people are insane.

750
00:48:34,708 --> 00:48:37,250
- Yeah, they're like you. A little weird, but nice.
- No.

751
00:48:37,333 --> 00:48:39,333
Plus, my arm. You know, I really...

752
00:48:39,416 --> 00:48:41,166
I ought to give it a little more time.

753
00:48:44,416 --> 00:48:47,291
Okay. Titus, look,

754
00:48:47,375 --> 00:48:48,916
I get why you'd want to stay.

755
00:48:49,000 --> 00:48:51,291
Okay? I really do, I...

756
00:48:51,375 --> 00:48:54,833
I know this must all seem really nice
compared to the-the shoot show

757
00:48:54,916 --> 00:48:55,916
that's up there.

758
00:48:56,000 --> 00:48:58,541
I wouldn't blame you
if you wanted to go back on our deal

759
00:48:58,625 --> 00:49:02,041
and-and just be somewhere
that is good and safe.

760
00:49:03,625 --> 00:49:05,041
But this isn't it.

761
00:49:05,125 --> 00:49:06,958
They gave me a robe.

762
00:49:07,041 --> 00:49:08,041
I know.

763
00:49:08,083 --> 00:49:10,000
And slippers.

764
00:49:11,500 --> 00:49:13,583
These people are hiding something from us

765
00:49:13,666 --> 00:49:15,666
and I'm gonna prove it to you, okay?

766
00:49:15,750 --> 00:49:16,870
I'm not leaving without you.
