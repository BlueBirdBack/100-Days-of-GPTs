1
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:13,083
<i>I know
we're all hurting right now.</i>

2
00:00:14,125 --> 00:00:16,958
But our priority has to be to maintain

3
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:18,833
the security of this Vault.

4
00:00:18,875 --> 00:00:20,226
They don't want to find Dad.

5
00:00:20,250 --> 00:00:22,017
If they did,
they wouldn't get to be in charge.

6
00:00:22,041 --> 00:00:23,625
<i>I'm bringing him home.</i>

7
00:00:25,375 --> 00:00:26,458
Hit him again!

8
00:00:28,791 --> 00:00:31,166
Oh! Shoot it!

9
00:00:33,041 --> 00:00:35,750
You stupid motherfucker,
you know this is all your fault.

10
00:00:35,791 --> 00:00:37,541
They'll kill you for this.

11
00:00:37,666 --> 00:00:39,306
<i>Not if I bring back the target.</i>

12
00:00:39,375 --> 00:00:42,083
You can change the future

13
00:00:42,166 --> 00:00:46,000
if you can bring me to Moldaver.

14
00:00:46,958 --> 00:00:48,291
Just my head.

15
00:00:48,833 --> 00:00:51,875
<i>You are a vault dweller,</i>

16
00:00:51,958 --> 00:00:53,750
<i>but if you're going to survive,</i>

17
00:00:53,833 --> 00:00:55,793
<i>you need to start acting
like a surface dweller.</i>

18
00:00:57,000 --> 00:00:58,291
<i>Question is,</i>

19
00:00:58,375 --> 00:01:00,916
<i>will you still want the same things...</i>

20
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:08,000
<i>...when you have become
a different animal altogether?</i>

21
00:01:42,166 --> 00:01:44,416
Please, sir.

22
00:01:44,500 --> 00:01:47,458
Please, sir, please.

23
00:01:50,500 --> 00:01:52,583
There's an old Mexican eulogy.

24
00:01:52,666 --> 00:01:55,666
<i>Feo fuerte y formal.</i>

25
00:01:55,750 --> 00:01:58,916
Means he was ugly, strong,

26
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:00,958
and had dignity.

27
00:02:01,041 --> 00:02:02,916
Well, Joey,

28
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:06,708
I'll give you
two out of three on that front.

29
00:02:21,458 --> 00:02:23,500
Do I really have to kill him?

30
00:02:23,583 --> 00:02:26,416
Cut.

31
00:02:29,208 --> 00:02:31,750
Emil, can you come over here?
I got to talk to you for a second.

32
00:02:31,833 --> 00:02:33,083
Yeah, here you go.

33
00:02:33,166 --> 00:02:35,267
That was a hell of a day, Jorge.
That was a great scene.

34
00:02:35,291 --> 00:02:38,166
Listen, I got to talk to you
about these, these new pages, you know?

35
00:02:38,250 --> 00:02:40,458
I mean, I-I'm the sheriff, right?

36
00:02:40,541 --> 00:02:42,781
Well, why can't I just arrest the guy
like I normally do?

37
00:02:42,833 --> 00:02:45,750
- That's what I do. All right.
- The au... the audience, Coop, yeah?

38
00:02:45,833 --> 00:02:47,625
They already know you're a good man.

39
00:02:47,708 --> 00:02:49,875
They want to see that even a good man

40
00:02:49,958 --> 00:02:52,434
- as yourself can be driven too far sometimes.
- Yeah, I understand that.

41
00:02:52,458 --> 00:02:54,559
But that's not really my thing,
you know, Emil, that's not what I do.

42
00:02:54,583 --> 00:02:56,958
I mean, is Bob,
is Bob around here anywhere?

43
00:02:57,041 --> 00:02:59,291
- Bob's been fired, Coop.
- What?

44
00:02:59,375 --> 00:03:01,291
Studio fired him.

45
00:03:01,375 --> 00:03:02,916
Why?

46
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:04,958
See, turns out...

47
00:03:05,041 --> 00:03:07,375
Bob's a bit of a communist.

48
00:03:07,458 --> 00:03:09,375
- A communist? Cadillac Bob?
- Yeah.

49
00:03:09,458 --> 00:03:11,166
Cadillac Bob! The very one.

50
00:03:11,250 --> 00:03:13,434
- Well, what a shame, he was such a great writer.
- Terrible shame.

51
00:03:13,458 --> 00:03:15,750
One of the best, but he had to go.

52
00:03:15,833 --> 00:03:18,083
Which is why this movie is so important.

53
00:03:18,166 --> 00:03:20,166
- Right.
- You see, it's a new kind of western.

54
00:03:20,250 --> 00:03:23,541
The power of the individual
when the chips are down.

55
00:03:23,625 --> 00:03:25,875
The new America,
it's why I'm telling you, so...

56
00:03:25,958 --> 00:03:28,916
that's why it'd be
really great if you could just...

57
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:31,708
shoot Jorge in the fucking head, yeah?

58
00:03:31,791 --> 00:03:34,166
- Please. 'Cause out here...
- Right.

59
00:03:34,250 --> 00:03:38,333
...it's just you, your gun,
and your personal code bringing order

60
00:03:38,416 --> 00:03:40,833
- to the Wild Wild West!
- Yeah. Uh, hey, let's, uh,

61
00:03:40,916 --> 00:03:42,916
let's pick this up after lunch, all right?

62
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:51,166
You gonna save any of
that grape taffy for the rest of us?

63
00:03:51,250 --> 00:03:53,958
It's not grape. It's lavender.

64
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:56,750
Well, if you like the taste of lavender,

65
00:03:56,833 --> 00:03:58,500
why not just drink a bottle of perfume?

66
00:03:59,750 --> 00:04:02,875
You know, a lot of people like
to write it off as some old lady flavor,

67
00:04:02,958 --> 00:04:05,500
but it's subtle.

68
00:04:05,583 --> 00:04:07,791
Flirtatious.

69
00:04:07,875 --> 00:04:11,000
Tastes like someone touching you
for the first time.

70
00:04:12,708 --> 00:04:15,250
Well, may I?

71
00:04:20,958 --> 00:04:22,958
Mm.

72
00:04:28,541 --> 00:04:31,791
Um, that's the worst thing...

73
00:04:31,875 --> 00:04:34,166
...I've ever put in my mouth.

74
00:04:34,250 --> 00:04:36,416
- That's horrible.
- Taffy?

75
00:04:36,500 --> 00:04:39,625
Um, you got to ask your mother.

76
00:04:39,708 --> 00:04:42,208
- Please, Mommy?
- Sure, sweetheart.

77
00:04:42,291 --> 00:04:44,416
Oh, wow.

78
00:04:44,500 --> 00:04:46,458
Unbelievable. Hey.

79
00:04:46,541 --> 00:04:47,916
Mm.

80
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:49,500
Oh, sorry, makeup.

81
00:04:55,708 --> 00:04:58,291
Sorry, lipstick.

82
00:04:58,375 --> 00:05:00,208
I'll take it.

83
00:05:00,291 --> 00:05:01,958
- Okay, we should get going.
- All right.

84
00:05:02,041 --> 00:05:03,708
Photographer's ready and waiting.

85
00:05:03,791 --> 00:05:05,333
Okay, what is this?

86
00:05:05,416 --> 00:05:08,541
A bit of a costume change
for you, Mr. Howard.

87
00:05:08,625 --> 00:05:10,625
Ah, okay.

88
00:05:12,166 --> 00:05:14,791
Oh, look at that.

89
00:05:16,791 --> 00:05:20,208
They even made it in your color.

90
00:05:20,291 --> 00:05:22,333
Let's see if it fits.

91
00:05:22,416 --> 00:05:24,291
Okay, Janey.

92
00:05:24,375 --> 00:05:26,708
Let's go.

93
00:05:26,791 --> 00:05:28,416
Come on, here. Come here.

94
00:06:46,875 --> 00:06:49,458

00:17:26,791 --> 00:17:28,750
I am Thaddeus.

183
00:17:30,208 --> 00:17:32,041
And I am honored to be in your charge.

184
00:17:34,291 --> 00:17:38,375
I vow to protect and serve you
however you deem fit.

185
00:17:41,833 --> 00:17:43,541
My Lord,

186
00:17:43,625 --> 00:17:45,916
have I said something wrong?

187
00:17:50,958 --> 00:17:52,598
I do not know what I have done to offend,

188
00:17:52,666 --> 00:17:54,250
but I beg for mercy!

189
00:17:54,333 --> 00:17:56,625
Please. Please.

190
00:17:56,708 --> 00:17:58,333
Please, please...

191
00:17:59,333 --> 00:18:00,500
Knight Titus!

192
00:18:00,583 --> 00:18:03,291
Please! I-I'll do anything!

193
00:18:04,666 --> 00:18:06,625
Arise, my squire.

194
00:18:08,375 --> 00:18:10,250
And clean this.

195
00:18:13,375 --> 00:18:15,541
Of course, Knight Titus.

196
00:18:19,291 --> 00:18:21,750
I also bring new orders
from the Elder Cleric.

197
00:18:21,833 --> 00:18:24,166
Uh, which I humbly relay.

198
00:18:25,250 --> 00:18:27,375
Mm.

199
00:18:27,458 --> 00:18:30,178
We're not the only ones in search
of this remnant from the old world.

200
00:18:30,208 --> 00:18:32,583
The Elder Cleric says

201
00:18:32,666 --> 00:18:34,666
whoever gets the target

202
00:18:34,750 --> 00:18:36,583
will control the Wasteland.

203
00:18:36,666 --> 00:18:38,291
And, uh...

204
00:18:38,375 --> 00:18:40,708
we are to kill whomever stands in our way.

205
00:18:46,166 --> 00:18:48,166
Understood.

206
00:20:00,916 --> 00:20:03,333
You like grass?

207
00:20:13,750 --> 00:20:14,958
Hi.

208
00:21:41,916 --> 00:21:43,458
Huh.

209
00:21:45,583 --> 00:21:47,208
Hello again.

210
00:21:50,708 --> 00:21:52,791
Where is it?

211
00:21:52,875 --> 00:21:55,000
The head.

212
00:22:07,166 --> 00:22:08,666
No.

213
00:22:08,750 --> 00:22:10,833
Okay, okay, I-I don't know

214
00:22:10,916 --> 00:22:13,458
where it is, okay? I lost it.

215
00:22:15,750 --> 00:22:17,750
I lost it.

216
00:22:20,666 --> 00:22:22,291
Huh.

217
00:22:32,333 --> 00:22:34,583
Huh.

218
00:22:36,583 --> 00:22:39,041

The whole "opening the Vault door

227
00:23:10,041 --> 00:23:12,583
didn't sit too well
with the Council, so...

228
00:23:12,666 --> 00:23:15,791

You know why you're in here?

240
00:23:55,583 --> 00:23:57,101
'Cause I helped my sister
escape the Vault.

241
00:23:57,125 --> 00:24:00,041
Escape? You and Chet put your sister
in incredible danger

242
00:24:00,125 --> 00:24:01,791
by helping her out that Vault door.

243
00:24:01,875 --> 00:24:03,916
- The rad levels up there alone...
- Worse,

244
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:05,916
you could've gotten us all killed.

245
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:08,375
What do you think started all this?

246
00:24:08,458 --> 00:24:10,291
These Vaults are impenetrable.

247
00:24:10,375 --> 00:24:12,642
Meaning those raiders
could only have gotten into Vault 32

248
00:24:12,666 --> 00:24:16,125
because some bonehead
opened the door to the surface.

249
00:24:16,208 --> 00:24:19,666
A single bad decision
that put everyone at risk.

250
00:24:19,750 --> 00:24:24,958
Not just Vault 32, but 33 and 31 as well.

251
00:24:25,041 --> 00:24:28,666
I've telegrammed with the Overseer
at Vault 31.

252
00:24:28,750 --> 00:24:31,250
Thank goodness they're unscathed.

253
00:24:31,333 --> 00:24:35,333
But you could've destroyed
the last vestiges of civilization.

254
00:24:35,416 --> 00:24:36,791
It was Lucy's idea.

255
00:24:36,875 --> 00:24:38,767
And you didn't think
to at least try and stop her?

256
00:24:38,791 --> 00:24:39,791
No.

257
00:24:40,791 --> 00:24:42,416
What are we gonna do with you?

258
00:24:43,625 --> 00:24:45,625
Punish me with a demotion, I guess.

259
00:24:48,833 --> 00:24:52,208
You've worked janitorial.
You've done kitchen duty.

260
00:24:52,291 --> 00:24:55,833
Are you aware that, at every job
you've been assigned to,

261
00:24:55,916 --> 00:24:59,083
your performance review has been
"lacks enthusiasm"?

262
00:25:00,416 --> 00:25:02,083
No, but that sounds accurate.

263
00:25:03,541 --> 00:25:06,500
You're currently working with Computers

264
00:25:06,583 --> 00:25:08,750
and Information Maintenance.

265
00:25:08,833 --> 00:25:10,041
How do you like that?

266
00:25:11,250 --> 00:25:12,916
I lack enthusiasm.

267
00:25:13,958 --> 00:25:15,083
Uh-huh.

268
00:25:16,708 --> 00:25:18,916
It's a predicament, isn't it?

269
00:25:19,000 --> 00:25:22,708
How do you demote someone who equally
dislikes every job he's ever worked?

270
00:25:23,875 --> 00:25:25,166
I suppose it is.

271
00:25:25,250 --> 00:25:28,333
I'm just glad to hear that we punish
people down here for breaking the rules.

272
00:25:28,416 --> 00:25:31,083
Is that just for vault dwellers,
or for people who come down here

273
00:25:31,166 --> 00:25:33,000
and murder vault dwellers?

274
00:25:40,125 --> 00:25:43,208
Now that I think of it,

275
00:25:43,291 --> 00:25:45,958

00:27:29,291 --> 00:27:31,791

305
00:27:31,875 --> 00:27:34,083
Okay.

306
00:27:34,166 --> 00:27:36,041
Uh, if we find the target,

307
00:27:36,125 --> 00:27:37,833
we should repair your radio

308
00:27:37,916 --> 00:27:40,666
so we can ask the Brotherhood
to send reinforcements.

309
00:27:42,041 --> 00:27:44,458
I will retrieve it myself.

310
00:27:44,541 --> 00:27:46,208
Understood. Understood.

311
00:27:46,291 --> 00:27:48,208
I never doubted your ability to do so.

312
00:27:57,416 --> 00:28:00,750
The guy from the Enclave,
the guy everybody's looking for,

313
00:28:00,833 --> 00:28:02,000
you saw him?

314
00:28:02,083 --> 00:28:04,458
I did. He left with a girl.

315
00:28:04,541 --> 00:28:06,708
- A woman.
- How'd they get away?

316
00:28:06,791 --> 00:28:10,041
I was waylaid. A ghoul intervened.

317
00:28:10,125 --> 00:28:13,583
A ghoul?! Huh.
Those things are scary as shit.

318
00:28:13,666 --> 00:28:15,476
I bet you just killed it on sight,
no questions asked.

319
00:28:15,500 --> 00:28:16,875
"Oh, you're a ghoul?

320
00:28:16,958 --> 00:28:19,291
- You're a dead ghoul."
- No.

321
00:28:19,375 --> 00:28:22,333
If we find the ghoul, we find the target.

322
00:28:22,416 --> 00:28:24,291
You left the ghoul alive?

323
00:28:26,041 --> 00:28:27,291
Great idea, sir.

324
00:28:27,375 --> 00:28:30,000
All wastelanders leave radiation trails.

325
00:28:30,083 --> 00:28:33,083
By allowing the ghoul to live,
you've made it possible

326
00:28:33,166 --> 00:28:36,666
to trace the whereabouts of the...
of the target.

327
00:28:38,250 --> 00:28:42,083
Yes, right. I know that.

328
00:28:43,416 --> 00:28:45,208
I got a trail.

329
00:28:45,291 --> 00:28:47,458
Yeah. Well done, sir.

330
00:28:47,541 --> 00:28:50,583
This way. Glory awaits!

331
00:28:53,125 --> 00:28:54,791
Oh, yes.

332
00:29:04,458 --> 00:29:05,916
Think this was him?

333
00:29:07,458 --> 00:29:09,125
Hard to tell.

334
00:29:09,208 --> 00:29:11,458
Show me the illustration.

335
00:29:14,583 --> 00:29:17,041
Oh, yeah.

336
00:29:17,125 --> 00:29:19,041
Yeah, that-that's definitely him.

337
00:29:19,125 --> 00:29:21,791
Think we should, uh,
bring the body back with us?

338
00:29:21,875 --> 00:29:23,416
No.

339
00:29:23,500 --> 00:29:25,875
If they left the body,
it must be worthless.

340
00:29:25,958 --> 00:29:28,750
His head is what's valuable.
We need to find it.

341
00:29:28,833 --> 00:29:30,333
Oh, yeah, smart.

342
00:29:30,416 --> 00:29:31,809
Who do you think did this,
the girl or the ghoul?

343
00:29:31,833 --> 00:29:35,291
The ghoul. Definitely.

344
00:29:35,375 --> 00:29:36,541
Ghouls.

345
00:29:36,625 --> 00:29:40,083
One day the Brotherhood's gonna eradicate
every last one of those freaks.

346
00:29:40,166 --> 00:29:43,458
Stuff like this is never
gonna happen again.

347
00:29:44,791 --> 00:29:48,791
Okay, so I think that the ghoul probably

348
00:29:48,875 --> 00:29:51,958
should be, I think, uh, well...

349
00:29:52,041 --> 00:29:54,916
Yeah, definitely this, um...

350
00:29:56,791 --> 00:29:59,958
Yeah, that way.
Definitely... definitely that way.

351
00:30:00,041 --> 00:30:02,041
There's tracks.

352
00:30:18,458 --> 00:30:20,166
Stop, please!

353
00:30:21,750 --> 00:30:23,875
My dad, he's an Overseer.

354
00:30:23,958 --> 00:30:26,833
He-he got taken by raiders,
and I need that head to get him back.

355
00:30:26,916 --> 00:30:29,666
If you help me find him,
he'll do whatever you want.

356
00:30:47,291 --> 00:30:49,791
Stop. Stop!

357
00:30:49,875 --> 00:30:51,666
Torture is wrong.

358
00:30:53,166 --> 00:30:56,750
You know, they used to do these things

359
00:30:56,833 --> 00:30:59,416
called "studies."

360
00:30:59,500 --> 00:31:01,208
Why, you couldn't open a newspaper

361
00:31:01,291 --> 00:31:04,000
without reading about
one study or another.

362
00:31:04,083 --> 00:31:06,559
Anyway, this one particular study came out,

363
00:31:06,583 --> 00:31:11,375
and it said that torturing a person
don't do shit.

364
00:31:25,541 --> 00:31:27,291
It made sense.

365
00:31:27,375 --> 00:31:29,416
I mean, a man hurts me,

366
00:31:29,500 --> 00:31:31,750
I wouldn't want to do him any favors.

367
00:31:31,833 --> 00:31:35,625
And yet the practice of torture
failed to vanish from this earth.

368
00:31:35,708 --> 00:31:39,250
In fact, as time marched on,

369
00:31:39,333 --> 00:31:44,416
I've personally noticed
a decided uptick...

370
00:31:45,583 --> 00:31:47,892
...in the amount of torture
being doled out across the board.

371
00:31:47,916 --> 00:31:50,875
Sir, please, I need the head.

372
00:31:50,958 --> 00:31:53,625
It's the only way
I can get my father back.

373
00:31:53,708 --> 00:31:55,958
My point is...

374
00:31:56,041 --> 00:32:00,583
if you ask me, them studies,
they was right.

375
00:32:00,666 --> 00:32:03,125
Torturing a person don't do shit.

376
00:32:03,208 --> 00:32:06,666
Then why... why are you doing this?

377
00:32:06,750 --> 00:32:09,666
Well, I ain't torturing you, sweetheart.

378
00:32:10,708 --> 00:32:12,625
I'm using you as bait.

379
00:32:23,000 --> 00:32:24,000
Nice.

380
00:33:53,541 --> 00:33:55,250
Ah.

381
00:34:15,125 --> 00:34:16,916
Motherfucker!

382
00:34:17,916 --> 00:34:21,583
Oh, I'm sorry, I should have
just let you use me as bait

383
00:34:21,666 --> 00:34:23,250
in a poison river?!

384
00:34:27,875 --> 00:34:28,958
Fuck!

385
00:34:29,041 --> 00:34:30,916
You can't treat people like this.

386
00:34:31,000 --> 00:34:32,583
Yeah? Why's that?

387
00:34:34,375 --> 00:34:36,125
Because of the golden rule.

388
00:34:37,583 --> 00:34:41,041
"Do unto others as you would have
done unto you."

389
00:34:43,333 --> 00:34:45,916
Those Gulpers digest real slow.

390
00:34:46,000 --> 00:34:47,833
You got time.

391
00:34:56,625 --> 00:34:58,208
No. No, no, no.

392
00:34:58,291 --> 00:34:59,416
No. Stop.

393
00:35:03,750 --> 00:35:05,541
Where are we going?

394
00:35:05,625 --> 00:35:06,833
What about the head?

395
00:35:06,916 --> 00:35:08,333
I need the head to get my dad back.

396
00:35:08,416 --> 00:35:10,583
Yeah, well, the Wasteland's got
its own golden rule.

397
00:35:10,666 --> 00:35:11,666
Oh? What's that?

398
00:35:11,750 --> 00:35:15,250
Thou shalt get sidetracked by bullshit
every goddamn time.

399
00:35:17,000 --> 00:35:19,333
- What about the dog?
- He ain't mine.

400
00:35:34,125 --> 00:35:37,166
Sorry, I've been derelict
in my duties here.

401
00:35:39,958 --> 00:35:41,208
What are you doing?

402
00:35:41,291 --> 00:35:44,875
Uh, just refilling your water bag
so you can stay hydrated.

403
00:35:46,500 --> 00:35:47,666
Right.

404
00:35:50,916 --> 00:35:55,166
Uh, it might be faster if you sit down.

405
00:35:59,125 --> 00:36:01,875
Bet you, uh, seen some things, huh?

406
00:36:01,958 --> 00:36:03,791
Being a knight.

407
00:36:03,875 --> 00:36:05,458
I've seen some things.

408
00:36:05,541 --> 00:36:08,041
I grew up working on a fly farm.

409
00:36:08,125 --> 00:36:10,166
I was a shitter, so they'd feed us,

410
00:36:10,250 --> 00:36:13,125
and then they'd feed our shit
to the flies.

411
00:36:13,208 --> 00:36:15,833
Mulch 'em up and sell it as protein.

412
00:36:15,916 --> 00:36:17,458
Anyway, that's why I'm so fat.

413
00:36:21,291 --> 00:36:24,375
So, your, uh, former squire,

414
00:36:24,458 --> 00:36:26,166
how did he die?

415
00:36:27,208 --> 00:36:29,125
You knew him?

416
00:36:29,208 --> 00:36:31,250
Yeah, I... I did.

417
00:36:31,333 --> 00:36:32,833
Say something about him.

418
00:36:32,916 --> 00:36:36,000
Well, he, uh, he was a good guy.

419
00:36:38,250 --> 00:36:40,458
Say something negative about him.

420
00:36:40,541 --> 00:36:45,250
Well, uh, he-he's dead.
I don't know, it feels weird.

421
00:36:45,333 --> 00:36:48,416
- An order, my squire.
- Okay.

422
00:36:48,500 --> 00:36:51,375
Uh, to be honest,

423
00:36:51,458 --> 00:36:55,291
me and the other guys used
to be pretty hard on him.

424
00:36:55,375 --> 00:36:57,583
Like, regularly beat the shit out of him.

425
00:36:57,666 --> 00:36:59,541
It wasn't personal, you know.

426
00:36:59,625 --> 00:37:01,083
It's just...

427
00:37:02,333 --> 00:37:05,000
...well, you know, people at the base,

428
00:37:05,083 --> 00:37:08,458
they used to beat the shit out of me
all the time.

429
00:37:09,958 --> 00:37:14,666
This shipment of new recruits came in,
and, uh, one of them was Maximus.

430
00:37:14,750 --> 00:37:16,291
So I had this funny idea,

431
00:37:16,375 --> 00:37:18,708
what if we beat the shit
out of that guy instead?

432
00:37:18,791 --> 00:37:20,583
And it worked.

433
00:37:20,666 --> 00:37:24,083
Yeah, I was really popular. It was great.

434
00:37:24,166 --> 00:37:27,184
I just wish he'd lived long enough to find
someone else to beat up, you know?

435
00:37:27,208 --> 00:37:29,333
Only seems fair.

436
00:37:29,416 --> 00:37:31,875
I realize that, uh,
people die all the time.

437
00:37:31,958 --> 00:37:34,458
It's the law of the Wasteland,
so who cares, right?

438
00:37:35,666 --> 00:37:39,458
But still, uh, I feel bad.

439
00:37:41,333 --> 00:37:43,458
Don't feel bad.

440
00:37:43,541 --> 00:37:47,750
It's like you said,
it's the law of the Wasteland.

441
00:37:49,791 --> 00:37:52,541
Let's go. We're losing daylight.

442
00:37:52,625 --> 00:37:54,625
Yeah.

443
00:38:02,791 --> 00:38:04,666
Coming!

444
00:38:09,875 --> 00:38:12,250
We can judge a person,
and a society,

445
00:38:12,333 --> 00:38:13,875
by how they treat their enemy.

446
00:38:13,958 --> 00:38:17,416
And here we are
with 16 highly-violent individuals

447
00:38:17,500 --> 00:38:21,291
incarcerated in our temporarily
repurposed reading room.

448
00:38:21,375 --> 00:38:24,125
It's an ethical dilemma
like nothing we've dealt with before.

449
00:38:24,208 --> 00:38:26,958
Personally, I'd say
it's more of an ethical opportunity

450
00:38:27,041 --> 00:38:30,583
to demonstrate to the surface dwellers,
and to each other,

451
00:38:30,666 --> 00:38:34,166
what we mean when we say
we're going to build a better world.

452
00:38:34,250 --> 00:38:36,750
Thanks, Reg.
That is a positive spin to put on it.

453
00:38:36,833 --> 00:38:38,934
It's not a positive spin for me.

454
00:38:38,958 --> 00:38:40,875
It's the goshdarn truth!

455
00:38:40,958 --> 00:38:43,875
Okay, well, uh, the fact remains

456
00:38:43,958 --> 00:38:46,416
we need to decide
what to do with these prisoners.

457
00:38:46,500 --> 00:38:49,875
And that is a decision
that we need to make as a collective.

458
00:38:49,958 --> 00:38:52,458
In a manner befitting our shared values.

459
00:38:52,541 --> 00:38:55,166
Yes.

460
00:38:57,250 --> 00:39:02,125
I think this conversation would benefit
from some actual ideas.

461
00:39:02,208 --> 00:39:04,375
Well, you know what?

462
00:39:04,458 --> 00:39:06,916
The young man
Woody interrogated this morning?

463
00:39:07,000 --> 00:39:08,791
He left an impression on me.

464
00:39:08,875 --> 00:39:11,416
That is the gentleman
who showed me his butthole.

465
00:39:11,500 --> 00:39:13,226
Yes, but what I took from that

466
00:39:13,250 --> 00:39:15,583
is a desire to communicate.

467
00:39:15,666 --> 00:39:18,041
To reach out
across the cultural divide.

468
00:39:18,125 --> 00:39:20,500
That's a spark we can work with...

469
00:39:20,583 --> 00:39:22,583
to create a great citizen.

470
00:39:22,666 --> 00:39:25,041
Given our recently dwindled numbers,

471
00:39:25,125 --> 00:39:28,791
the most ethical solution would be
to rehabilitate the prisoners

472
00:39:28,875 --> 00:39:31,458
and then integrate them
into our Vault Society.

473
00:39:34,083 --> 00:39:38,666
To be clear, this is not a process
that will happen overnight.

474
00:39:38,750 --> 00:39:40,708
Based on what I saw this morning,

475
00:39:40,791 --> 00:39:43,500
it may take years.

476
00:39:43,583 --> 00:39:45,958
- But...
- But... there is nothing

477
00:39:46,041 --> 00:39:48,708
we can't do
when we set our minds to it!

478
00:39:48,791 --> 00:39:51,416
- Yes!
- Yes!

479
00:39:52,750 --> 00:39:57,125
I can teach the raiders Shakespeare...
and when they're ready, Marlowe.

480
00:39:57,208 --> 00:39:58,851
I don't want to be insensitive,

481
00:39:58,875 --> 00:40:01,916
but I think Shakespeare might be
too advanced for these people.

482
00:40:02,000 --> 00:40:04,041
Look, I would like
to start with a moral framework.

483
00:40:04,125 --> 00:40:06,375
Kant, Mill and-and so on.

484
00:40:06,458 --> 00:40:08,875
I'd be happy to teach them
introductory calculus.

485
00:40:10,416 --> 00:40:12,166
Is there something
you'd like to say,

486
00:40:12,250 --> 00:40:14,250
Norm?

487
00:40:18,416 --> 00:40:20,809
I don't know. I don't think
it's our job to help these people.

488
00:40:20,833 --> 00:40:23,625
- They're murderers.
- They didn't know any better.

489
00:40:23,708 --> 00:40:25,208
And how could they

490
00:40:25,291 --> 00:40:27,500
- without a formal education?
- Norm,

491
00:40:27,583 --> 00:40:31,500
buddy, the hard truth is,
we can't just let them go.

492
00:40:31,583 --> 00:40:33,666
Uh, it's just,

493
00:40:33,750 --> 00:40:36,208
they have intimate knowledge
of our Vault security.

494
00:40:36,291 --> 00:40:39,500
So what do you propose we do?

495
00:40:41,500 --> 00:40:43,140
We can do
what they would have done to us.

496
00:40:43,166 --> 00:40:44,458
Wow.

497
00:40:44,541 --> 00:40:45,833
Geez Louise, Norm.

498
00:40:46,875 --> 00:40:48,833
Young Norm was

499
00:40:48,916 --> 00:40:50,916
just expressing a feeling.

500
00:40:51,000 --> 00:40:53,708
I know. I've got anger. We all do.

501
00:40:53,791 --> 00:40:55,833
But I think you would agree

502
00:40:55,916 --> 00:41:00,166
that murdering these prisoners of ours
is not under serious consideration.

503
00:41:00,250 --> 00:41:01,708
That's right.

504
00:41:01,791 --> 00:41:03,208
Hear! Hear!

505
00:41:03,291 --> 00:41:05,583
I'm sorry. You're right.

506
00:41:05,666 --> 00:41:08,375
It was not my intention
to question your leadership, Overseer.

507
00:41:08,458 --> 00:41:10,625
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

508
00:41:10,708 --> 00:41:13,416
All right. Sirs?

509
00:41:13,500 --> 00:41:15,875
Uh, sirs? Uh, uh, may I...

510
00:41:15,958 --> 00:41:17,267
may I speak with you for a moment, please?

511
00:41:17,291 --> 00:41:18,541
Uh, it's about the Water Chip.

512
00:41:18,625 --> 00:41:20,500
Go ahead.

513
00:41:22,500 --> 00:41:24,791
Uh, it's-it's... it's the type of thing

514
00:41:24,875 --> 00:41:27,666
Overseer MacLean would have preferred
to discuss, uh, privately?

515
00:41:27,750 --> 00:41:29,541
Uh, before bringing it to the full group?

516
00:41:29,625 --> 00:41:32,250
Well, he's not here now, is he?

517
00:41:32,333 --> 00:41:34,041
Let's hear it.

518
00:41:34,125 --> 00:41:36,291
Okay, well, uh...

519
00:41:36,375 --> 00:41:37,916
the Water Chip is destroyed.

520
00:41:38,000 --> 00:41:40,392
The Vault only has enough water to keep

521
00:41:40,416 --> 00:41:42,416
our population alive for, uh, two months.

522
00:41:42,500 --> 00:41:44,958
And-and that's not accounting
for the prisoners, who...

523
00:41:45,041 --> 00:41:47,541
- Okay. That's fine, that's enough.
- Thanks, though.

524
00:41:47,625 --> 00:41:49,250
- Uh...
- Um...

525
00:41:49,333 --> 00:41:52,375
Okay.

526
00:41:52,458 --> 00:41:53,583
Uh... meeting adjourned.

527
00:41:53,666 --> 00:41:56,416
I was also gonna say
meeting adjourned, so...

528
00:41:57,375 --> 00:41:58,708
That went well.

529
00:42:05,708 --> 00:42:07,958
They killed my husband.

530
00:42:11,708 --> 00:42:14,208
You're right, you know.

531
00:42:14,291 --> 00:42:16,166
If your father were here, he...

532
00:42:18,375 --> 00:42:20,791
...he'd do the right thing.

533
00:42:44,583 --> 00:42:46,351
Are you sure
about this?

534
00:42:46,375 --> 00:42:47,726
It says the ghoul is this way.

535
00:42:49,416 --> 00:42:51,416
- Wait a minute.
- What?

536
00:42:52,583 --> 00:42:56,291
Uh, it's just, this, um... Well, uh...

537
00:42:56,375 --> 00:42:58,916
- What?
- It just occurred to me.

538
00:43:00,208 --> 00:43:03,625
Uh, we're definitely picking up
an abomination of some kind or another.

539
00:43:03,708 --> 00:43:05,291
Just not sure...

540
00:43:05,375 --> 00:43:07,916
I'm not sure
we're tracking the right abomination.

541
00:43:14,916 --> 00:43:17,250
- You idiot!
- It was my mistake.

542
00:43:17,333 --> 00:43:20,875
If you'll let me lead the charge,
I'll lead the charge.

543
00:43:24,041 --> 00:43:26,375
I am a Knight
of the Brotherhood of Steel.

544
00:43:26,458 --> 00:43:28,041
- Get back to shore.
- But sir...

545
00:43:28,125 --> 00:43:31,041
- Go!
- Thank you, sir.

546
00:44:09,500 --> 00:44:11,625
Fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck.

547
00:44:11,708 --> 00:44:15,166
- My lord!
- I've got you!

548
00:44:15,250 --> 00:44:16,500
Knight Titus!

549
00:44:26,291 --> 00:44:28,250

552
00:45:02,416 --> 00:45:03,958
Ah.

553
00:45:06,000 --> 00:45:07,666
- You saved me!
- Huh.

554
00:45:07,750 --> 00:45:10,083
You saved me first.

555
00:45:28,666 --> 00:45:30,666
Huh. Oh.

556
00:45:48,333 --> 00:45:50,541
Is that...?

557
00:45:50,625 --> 00:45:52,791
The head.

558
00:45:52,875 --> 00:45:54,458
The head?!

559
00:45:54,541 --> 00:45:56,750
It's the head! Yes!

560
00:45:56,833 --> 00:45:58,916
Yeah!

561
00:45:59,000 --> 00:46:00,416
Yeah!

562
00:46:50,541 --> 00:46:52,291

563
00:46:52,375 --> 00:46:55,333
Sir, please. I need water.

Please.

565
00:47:03,375 --> 00:47:04,791
Please!

566
00:47:54,750 --> 00:47:58,291
Water, water everywhere,
and not a drop to drink.
