1
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:12,000
<i>You can change</i>

2
00:00:12,083 --> 00:00:16,625
the future if you can bring me
to Moldaver.

3
00:00:17,625 --> 00:00:19,583
<i>Just my head.</i>

4
00:00:23,791 --> 00:00:26,625
<i>This is the only way
to get your dad back.</i>

5
00:00:27,375 --> 00:00:29,291
<i>You stupid motherfucker,</i>

6
00:00:29,375 --> 00:00:30,559
you know this is all your fault.

7
00:00:30,583 --> 00:00:32,416
<i>They'll kill you for this.</i>

8
00:00:32,500 --> 00:00:34,875
Not if I bring back the target.

9
00:00:43,958 --> 00:00:44,875
Is that...?

10
00:00:44,958 --> 00:00:45,958
The head.

11
00:00:46,041 --> 00:00:47,916
- Yeah!
- Whoo!

12
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:50,875
Is there something
you'd like to say, Norm?

13
00:00:50,958 --> 00:00:53,309
It was not my intention to question
your leadership, Overseer.

14
00:00:53,333 --> 00:00:54,958
Thank you.

15
00:00:55,041 --> 00:00:56,791
I don't know what the people of Vault 32

16
00:00:56,875 --> 00:01:00,041
<i>were up to,
but it was anything but innocent.</i>

17
00:01:01,250 --> 00:01:02,750
It was opened from the outside.

18
00:01:02,833 --> 00:01:05,073
- They'd need a Pip-Boy to open the door.
- They had one.

19
00:01:06,125 --> 00:01:07,458
<i>My mom's.</i>

20
00:01:31,958 --> 00:01:33,833
I thought I had it.

21
00:01:33,916 --> 00:01:35,767
I thought I had it, I really did.
I thought I had it.

22
00:01:35,791 --> 00:01:38,559
It was just like...

23
00:01:38,583 --> 00:01:40,726
When you ripped that thing inside out

24
00:01:40,750 --> 00:01:42,583
and its guts went flying everywhere?

25
00:01:42,666 --> 00:01:44,375
I thought I was dead meat.

26
00:01:44,458 --> 00:01:46,208
That was really special.

27
00:01:46,291 --> 00:01:48,142
Yeah,
it was kind of special.

28
00:01:48,166 --> 00:01:51,458
Wait. You should brand me.

29
00:01:51,541 --> 00:01:53,333
Uh, I don't know.

30
00:01:53,416 --> 00:01:56,500
But I-I'm not officially your squire
until you brand me.

31
00:01:56,583 --> 00:01:58,875
- It's late.
- Come on.

32
00:01:58,958 --> 00:02:00,666
Are you sure? It really hurts.

33
00:02:00,750 --> 00:02:03,750
I want you to. I want you to. Please.

34
00:02:04,750 --> 00:02:06,666
All right.

35
00:02:06,750 --> 00:02:07,958
Yeah, let's do it.

36
00:02:09,416 --> 00:02:11,500
It is your most sacred duty

37
00:02:11,541 --> 00:02:13,000
to protect the Brotherhood.

38
00:02:13,041 --> 00:02:15,083
After which, it is your most sacred duty

39
00:02:15,166 --> 00:02:18,958
to protect me, Knight Titus.

40
00:02:19,041 --> 00:02:20,041
Do you accept?

41
00:02:20,125 --> 00:02:22,875
Oh, yeah. You bet I do.

42
00:02:22,958 --> 00:02:25,083
Okay, hold still.

43
00:02:31,125 --> 00:02:33,333
Almost done.

44
00:02:33,416 --> 00:02:37,000
Oh...

45
00:02:37,083 --> 00:02:39,750
Told you. It hurts.

46
00:02:39,833 --> 00:02:41,833
Oh...

47
00:02:41,916 --> 00:02:44,541
Oh, man.

48
00:02:44,625 --> 00:02:47,208
Still pretty hot.

49
00:02:47,291 --> 00:02:49,125
Ah, thank you, Knight Titus.

50
00:02:49,208 --> 00:02:51,583
- Yep, yeah.
- I cannot wait

51
00:02:51,666 --> 00:02:54,875
to return to base
and see the look on everyone's faces

52
00:02:54,958 --> 00:02:58,458
when they see us return with the target.

53
00:02:58,541 --> 00:02:59,791
Oh, man.

54
00:02:59,875 --> 00:03:01,750
Titus and Thaddeus.

55
00:03:01,833 --> 00:03:04,166
The T-Boys! Yeah.

56
00:03:08,875 --> 00:03:11,708
Hey, look, uh...

57
00:03:12,750 --> 00:03:14,291
Before we go back

58
00:03:14,375 --> 00:03:15,916
to the...

59
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:17,000
...to the base...

60
00:03:18,083 --> 00:03:23,333
...there's probably something
I... I-I should tell you.

61
00:03:23,416 --> 00:03:26,916
Yeah. I mean, whatever you want.

62
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:29,666
I'm officially your squire now.
You can tell me anything.

63
00:03:29,750 --> 00:03:34,375
Goals, insecurities, thoughts, regrets.

64
00:03:34,458 --> 00:03:36,666
Love life stuff? I don't care.

65
00:03:38,750 --> 00:03:41,208
Actually, it's, uh...

66
00:03:48,291 --> 00:03:50,291
Maximus.

67
00:03:55,250 --> 00:03:57,541
U-Uh, we can still be friends.

68
00:03:59,125 --> 00:04:01,416
What did you do?

69
00:04:01,500 --> 00:04:03,000
Where's Knight Titus?

70
00:04:03,083 --> 00:04:04,625
Oh, he's...

71
00:04:06,625 --> 00:04:07,916
He's dead.

72
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:10,250
So, you know...

73
00:04:10,333 --> 00:04:14,833
we... you and I, we-we just have
to get our story straight

74
00:04:14,916 --> 00:04:16,833
before we go back.

75
00:04:16,875 --> 00:04:20,125
- They're gonna kill you.
- No, I mean, they don't have to find out.

76
00:04:20,208 --> 00:04:23,375
It's the Brotherhood. They'll find out.

77
00:04:31,583 --> 00:04:33,750
I should have known better
than to trust you.

78
00:04:41,166 --> 00:04:42,666
I'm sorry.

79
00:04:48,166 --> 00:04:49,166
Stop moving.

80
00:04:51,833 --> 00:04:52,875
Get off me.

81
00:04:55,958 --> 00:04:57,791
Thadd...

82
00:04:59,500 --> 00:05:01,666
Thaddeus.

83
00:05:01,750 --> 00:05:03,416
No, don't...

84
00:05:03,500 --> 00:05:05,000
Don't leave me in here.

85
00:05:05,083 --> 00:05:08,333
- I'll fucking kill you, Thaddeus.
- You should have.

86
00:05:09,333 --> 00:05:11,416
Can't believe I let you fucking brand me.

87
00:05:12,708 --> 00:05:14,083
Thaddeus?

88
00:05:15,125 --> 00:05:16,583
Don't leave me here!

89
00:05:16,666 --> 00:05:18,625
This stinky old head's mine now.

90
00:05:18,708 --> 00:05:19,791
No!

91
00:05:19,875 --> 00:05:22,625
Get back here. Please. Please, please, no.

92
00:05:22,708 --> 00:05:25,000
Don't leave me in here.

93
00:05:25,083 --> 00:05:27,083
Thaddeus! Get back here.

94
00:05:28,708 --> 00:05:30,791
Thaddeus!

95
00:05:30,875 --> 00:05:34,333
I'll kill you! I swear I'll kill you!

96
00:06:19,333 --> 00:06:20,541
No. No.

97
00:06:23,083 --> 00:06:24,833
No. No.

98
00:06:24,916 --> 00:06:26,916
Plea... Please.

99
00:06:35,166 --> 00:06:37,666
Please, no, no, no, no. Not from there.

100
00:06:39,791 --> 00:06:42,833
No.

Hey.
Can you please let me out of here?

00:07:30,750 --> 00:07:33,541
That was you, right?

109
00:07:33,625 --> 00:07:35,791
- Back in Filly?
- Yes, that was...

110
00:07:36,833 --> 00:07:37,916
...that was me.

111
00:07:40,166 --> 00:07:41,833

00:07:41,916 --> 00:07:43,309

Believe me,
I really want to trust you, but...

117
00:07:55,208 --> 00:07:57,375
I've had a rough week.

118
00:07:57,458 --> 00:07:58,708
Yeah.

119
00:07:58,791 --> 00:08:01,083
Me, too.

120
00:08:06,041 --> 00:08:09,958
You, uh, remember that, uh,
man I left with,

121
00:08:10,041 --> 00:08:15,041
with the glasses and the wh-whole body?

122
00:08:15,125 --> 00:08:18,083
- Yes.
- Yeah, I'm looking for his head.

123
00:08:18,166 --> 00:08:19,625
That's why I'm here, that's, um...

124
00:08:19,708 --> 00:08:22,291
I mean, that's why
I'm passing through.

125
00:08:24,250 --> 00:08:27,083
Hey. You have radiation sickness.

126
00:08:27,166 --> 00:08:28,851
I got, I got RadAway
left in the sleeve of my armor.

127
00:08:28,875 --> 00:08:30,235
You can have it if you let me out.

128
00:08:34,041 --> 00:08:35,625
I really want to believe you, but...

129
00:08:35,666 --> 00:08:39,833
practically every person I've met up here
has tried to kill me, so...

130
00:08:39,916 --> 00:08:41,250
Listen. Hey.

131
00:08:41,333 --> 00:08:44,708
You don't get this medicine,
you're gonna pass out. Okay?

132
00:08:44,791 --> 00:08:48,666
And if you lose consciousness,
we're both gonna die.

133
00:08:49,750 --> 00:08:51,666
Trust me, please.

134
00:08:51,750 --> 00:08:53,375
Please.

135
00:08:55,916 --> 00:08:57,541
What's your name?

136
00:09:04,458 --> 00:09:06,958
I'm Knight Titus.

137
00:09:08,208 --> 00:09:09,916
I'm Lucy.

138
00:09:14,416 --> 00:09:16,333
There's a manual option, you just...

139
00:09:16,416 --> 00:09:18,708
I got it.

140
00:09:18,791 --> 00:09:20,333
Oh.

141
00:09:32,166 --> 00:09:34,541
The T-60, right?

142
00:09:34,625 --> 00:09:37,458
The Army started using these
after the Battle of Anchorage.

143
00:09:37,541 --> 00:09:42,000
I've seen these in old engineering manuals
but never in real life.

144
00:09:42,083 --> 00:09:45,166
And you've even got the tempered lining
in this one, which is...

145
00:10:05,666 --> 00:10:08,750
How did the raiders get ahold
of my mom's Pip-Boy?

146
00:10:09,833 --> 00:10:11,833
Maybe the logs were falsified.

147
00:10:11,916 --> 00:10:13,333
Why?

148
00:10:13,416 --> 00:10:16,291
Why? This is the thing
you're asking "why" about?

149
00:10:16,375 --> 00:10:19,291
- I want to check one more thing.
- No...

150
00:10:19,375 --> 00:10:21,666
Can't we just go home?

151
00:10:21,750 --> 00:10:23,041
Come on.

152
00:11:01,541 --> 00:11:05,333
It looks like they were trying
to get into 31, but why?

153
00:11:05,416 --> 00:11:06,875
All I know is,

154
00:11:06,958 --> 00:11:08,875
we're leaving.

155
00:11:23,291 --> 00:11:26,083
- If anybody asks where we were...
- I'll have a heart attack.

156
00:11:29,541 --> 00:11:32,458
Norman? Chester?

157
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:38,208
Where have you two been?

158
00:11:41,125 --> 00:11:43,750
- We've been planting tat-tatos.
- Tatos.

159
00:11:45,916 --> 00:11:48,583
Well, run along now.

160
00:12:14,750 --> 00:12:17,916
I had no idea people lived
in those vaults.

161
00:12:19,791 --> 00:12:21,583
What did you think was in them?

162
00:12:21,666 --> 00:12:24,583
Monsters.

163
00:12:24,666 --> 00:12:27,416
That's what people say.

164
00:12:27,500 --> 00:12:29,000
No.

165
00:12:29,083 --> 00:12:30,875
Just regular folk like me.

166
00:12:36,333 --> 00:12:39,208
Well, my squire stole something
vital to the Brotherhood.

167
00:12:39,291 --> 00:12:41,250
I've got to go after him.

168
00:12:43,375 --> 00:12:45,166
Good luck.

169
00:12:47,583 --> 00:12:48,583
Wait.

170
00:12:48,666 --> 00:12:51,125
This Brotherhood of yours...

171
00:12:51,208 --> 00:12:55,125
You guys have more of those T-60s?

172
00:12:55,208 --> 00:12:57,958
- Yeah.
- And guns?

173
00:12:58,041 --> 00:13:00,041
Like real...

174
00:13:00,125 --> 00:13:02,000
"I'm not messing around"-type guns?

175
00:13:02,083 --> 00:13:03,750
Yeah.

176
00:13:03,833 --> 00:13:08,916
Listen, I have a tracker
that'll lead right to that head.

177
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:13,333
Now, seeing as everybody on Earth
seems to be after that thing,

178
00:13:13,416 --> 00:13:16,625
I'm guessing that's what
you're looking for, too?

179
00:13:17,666 --> 00:13:19,250
What are you suggesting?

180
00:13:20,291 --> 00:13:22,416
We travel together.

181
00:13:22,500 --> 00:13:25,666
We use my tracker to catch up
to your squire, get the head,

182
00:13:25,750 --> 00:13:28,000
and take it to the Brotherhood.

183
00:13:28,083 --> 00:13:31,291
In exchange for my help,
then you'll lend me the services

184
00:13:31,375 --> 00:13:34,208
of five or six of your knights
to save my father.

185
00:13:42,208 --> 00:13:43,791
Look.

186
00:13:46,166 --> 00:13:48,606
You could have been lying
about the medicine, and you weren't.

187
00:13:50,500 --> 00:13:53,833
And you could have killed me
when I collapsed back there, and...

188
00:13:53,916 --> 00:13:55,791
you didn't.

189
00:13:57,583 --> 00:14:00,458
I get that trust doesn't
come easily up here.

190
00:14:01,541 --> 00:14:03,958
But you can trust me.

191
00:14:04,041 --> 00:14:07,708
I'm from a place where the worst
someone can do to you is

192
00:14:07,791 --> 00:14:10,083
forget to say thank you.

193
00:14:12,208 --> 00:14:15,166
Sounds like a nice way to live.

194
00:14:15,250 --> 00:14:17,500
It is.

I just feel that in times of crisis...

211
00:15:42,875 --> 00:15:45,583
you need someone with experience.

212
00:15:45,666 --> 00:15:47,333
Hey, it's your vote.

213
00:15:47,416 --> 00:15:49,375

- a-and just all the uncertainty...

217
00:16:01,041 --> 00:16:02,833
We vote in private booths for a reason.

218
00:16:02,916 --> 00:16:04,916

Mm.

Oh.

Hey, can I ask you a favor?

233
00:16:55,041 --> 00:16:56,875
Okay.

234
00:16:56,958 --> 00:17:00,000
Can you tell me what's happened
in the last 200 years?

235
00:17:00,083 --> 00:17:01,833
What do you mean?

236
00:17:01,916 --> 00:17:04,958
Just the last 200 years.
Like a-a quick rundown.

237
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:07,625
I know about the Great War
and the bombs falling,

238
00:17:07,708 --> 00:17:10,458
and the 320 years of American history
before then.

239
00:17:10,541 --> 00:17:13,333
I just need help with the last 200 years.

240
00:17:13,416 --> 00:17:14,708
After the bombs fell.

241
00:17:14,791 --> 00:17:17,250
The bombs fell when I was a kid.

242
00:17:17,333 --> 00:17:20,708
Is that what they tell you
in your Brotherhood?

243
00:17:22,458 --> 00:17:25,666
You're the one who grew up
in a box underground.

244
00:17:25,750 --> 00:17:28,458
Also, you thought you would show up
to some warlord

245
00:17:28,541 --> 00:17:31,666
with no armor, no help,
and expect him to just

246
00:17:31,750 --> 00:17:33,125
turn over a hostage to you?

247
00:17:33,208 --> 00:17:34,392
Did you really think that that would work?

248
00:17:34,416 --> 00:17:35,500
I had the head.

249
00:17:35,583 --> 00:17:37,708
Yeah, but we don't even know what's in it.

250
00:17:39,416 --> 00:17:41,250
That's true.

251
00:17:43,250 --> 00:17:47,583
Look, I... I come from a place where
the world is what you make of it.

252
00:17:47,666 --> 00:17:49,750
Okay? It's not like up here.

253
00:17:49,833 --> 00:17:52,958
We're naive down there.

254
00:17:53,041 --> 00:17:57,750
Up until I was six, I really thought
that the big light on our farm

255
00:17:57,833 --> 00:17:58,875
was the sun.

256
00:18:00,166 --> 00:18:03,000
<i>My mom used to take me
to play out under that light,</i>

257
00:18:03,083 --> 00:18:05,250
<i>and I swear I could feel the sun</i>

258
00:18:05,333 --> 00:18:06,958
<i>- baking my skin.</i>
- Lucy.

259
00:18:13,125 --> 00:18:14,791
<i>After my mom was gone,</i>

260
00:18:14,875 --> 00:18:19,750
I realized it was just her
that made it all feel so real.

261
00:18:31,875 --> 00:18:34,750
So, like, Earth is round,
Earth is flat.

262
00:18:34,833 --> 00:18:37,166
Where are you guys on that these days?

263
00:19:14,458 --> 00:19:17,250
<i>It is my honor to announce</i>

264
00:19:17,333 --> 00:19:22,291
that, with a 98% majority,

265
00:19:22,375 --> 00:19:27,166
<i>Betty Pearson has been elected
vault overseer.</i>

266
00:19:32,375 --> 00:19:35,041
I'm so honored...

267
00:19:35,125 --> 00:19:38,625
...to step into Hank MacLean's shoes.

268
00:19:38,708 --> 00:19:40,833
Better luck next time, Reg.

269
00:19:40,916 --> 00:19:43,708
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

270
00:19:57,333 --> 00:19:59,833
Congratulations, Overseer.

271
00:19:59,916 --> 00:20:01,500
Thank you.

272
00:20:19,958 --> 00:20:23,250
So, you guys use prewar technology

273
00:20:23,333 --> 00:20:25,416
to find and collect prewar technology

274
00:20:25,500 --> 00:20:28,000
to make sure no one has prewar technology?

275
00:20:28,083 --> 00:20:29,625
I mean... yeah.

276
00:20:29,708 --> 00:20:32,291
Well, when you say it like that,
I mean, yeah, it's...

277
00:20:32,375 --> 00:20:34,000
...it's weird.

278
00:20:50,625 --> 00:20:51,666
You armed?

279
00:20:51,750 --> 00:20:54,083
No.

280
00:20:54,166 --> 00:20:55,583
Yes, we are.

281
00:20:55,666 --> 00:20:57,833
Are you armed?

282
00:20:57,916 --> 00:20:59,333
No.

283
00:21:00,291 --> 00:21:02,625
We're just gonna walk on by.

284
00:21:02,708 --> 00:21:03,958
That okay with you?

285
00:21:04,041 --> 00:21:05,833
It's fine.

286
00:21:05,916 --> 00:21:07,041
Give me your gun.

287
00:21:07,125 --> 00:21:08,458
What? No.

288
00:21:08,541 --> 00:21:11,208
Okay, we're walking towards you.

289
00:21:11,291 --> 00:21:13,791
There's no one here but us and them.

290
00:21:13,875 --> 00:21:16,250
It's not safe. Give me your gun.

291
00:21:16,333 --> 00:21:18,375
- They said they're not armed.
- They're lying.

292
00:21:18,458 --> 00:21:19,458
You're lying.

293
00:21:19,500 --> 00:21:21,750
What's happening over there?

294
00:21:21,833 --> 00:21:24,791
Yeah, we're just being careful.
You can come on through.

295
00:21:25,958 --> 00:21:27,875
Are you trying to fuck us?

296
00:21:27,958 --> 00:21:29,208
The gun.

297
00:21:30,875 --> 00:21:35,541
Okay, uh, I think we're all
feeling some tension.

298
00:21:35,625 --> 00:21:37,041
Yeah?

299
00:21:38,166 --> 00:21:40,666
A little stress?

300
00:21:40,750 --> 00:21:45,291
Uh, so why don't we all take
a deep breath?

301
00:21:48,708 --> 00:21:50,541
What the fuck
are you talking about?!

302
00:21:56,708 --> 00:21:58,708
Oh, okay, uh...

303
00:21:59,833 --> 00:22:02,375
We're gonna do this.

304
00:22:08,083 --> 00:22:09,666
Um...

305
00:22:09,750 --> 00:22:14,666
How about on the count of three
we all raise up our arms?

306
00:22:14,750 --> 00:22:16,750
We already said we don't have any weapons.

307
00:22:16,833 --> 00:22:18,875
- And neither do we!
- Well, either way,

308
00:22:18,958 --> 00:22:22,041
could we... could we just give it a try?

309
00:22:22,125 --> 00:22:23,958
Please?

310
00:22:36,166 --> 00:22:38,083
Okay. Great.

311
00:22:38,166 --> 00:22:42,958
Uh, hands up on the count of three. Ready?

312
00:22:43,041 --> 00:22:44,958
One...

313
00:22:46,041 --> 00:22:48,500
Two...

314
00:22:49,916 --> 00:22:50,916
Three.

315
00:24:10,875 --> 00:24:13,541
Wh... Why?!

316
00:24:14,833 --> 00:24:16,166
Fiends.

317
00:24:17,291 --> 00:24:20,250
Should've known.

318
00:24:24,666 --> 00:24:26,458
You've been shot.

319
00:24:26,541 --> 00:24:29,041
It's just a scratch.

320
00:24:29,125 --> 00:24:31,583
Happens all the time.

321
00:24:37,083 --> 00:24:39,041
What's a fiend?

322
00:24:40,208 --> 00:24:42,500
It's people who eat people.

323
00:24:45,166 --> 00:24:47,833
I hate it up here.

324
00:25:16,291 --> 00:25:17,875
You ran a great campaign.

325
00:25:17,958 --> 00:25:19,750
I know.

326
00:25:19,833 --> 00:25:22,708
- Must've put ten posters up.
- Yeah.

327
00:25:22,791 --> 00:25:25,416
That's what you got to do.
You put a few posters up

328
00:25:25,500 --> 00:25:27,875
and let democracy run its course.

329
00:25:29,125 --> 00:25:31,500
You know, I ran once.

330
00:25:31,583 --> 00:25:34,750
And then that weevil famine came.

331
00:25:34,833 --> 00:25:37,333
Lost to none other than Hank MacLean.

332
00:25:37,416 --> 00:25:39,625
You know what they say.

333
00:25:39,708 --> 00:25:43,708
"When things look glum,
vote for somebody from Vault 31."

334
00:25:46,750 --> 00:25:48,625
Uh...

335
00:25:49,666 --> 00:25:51,791
I voted for Betty.

336
00:25:55,833 --> 00:25:58,875
Yeah.

337
00:26:08,083 --> 00:26:09,851
You don't think it's weird
that we always elect an overseer

338
00:26:09,875 --> 00:26:12,291
from Vault 31?

339
00:26:12,375 --> 00:26:14,916
They did the same exact thing in Vault 32.

340
00:26:17,666 --> 00:26:19,625
Honestly? No.

341
00:26:19,708 --> 00:26:22,125
By all accounts,
Vault 31 has more resources,

342
00:26:22,208 --> 00:26:24,791
a better education system, and...

343
00:26:24,875 --> 00:26:26,375
you know, they got that phrase.

344
00:26:26,458 --> 00:26:30,083
"When things look glum, vote 31."

345
00:26:30,166 --> 00:26:32,041
Shh.

346
00:26:32,125 --> 00:26:34,416
It's a powerful slogan.

347
00:26:41,333 --> 00:26:44,208
You think 200 years of coincidence
comes down to a slogan?

348
00:26:45,750 --> 00:26:49,083
You might as well be asking why everyone
prefers Jell-O cake to apple pie.

349
00:26:49,166 --> 00:26:52,750
I don't know why, they just do.

350
00:26:53,750 --> 00:26:56,916
So, if it's not at all worrisome,
why are we whispering?

351
00:26:57,000 --> 00:26:59,583
Because we just snuck
into a vault filled with dead bodies.

352
00:27:01,583 --> 00:27:03,583
Not to mention Steph's from Vault 31.

353
00:27:04,666 --> 00:27:07,458
Oh. Hello, Norman.

354
00:27:07,541 --> 00:27:10,208
Steph. I actually was just heading out.

355
00:27:10,291 --> 00:27:13,708
- We'll, uh, pick this up later.
- Hey, sure.

356
00:27:16,416 --> 00:27:18,375
- Steph?
- Hmm?

357
00:27:19,583 --> 00:27:21,916
How was Vault 31 different from here?

358
00:27:23,083 --> 00:27:24,583
What did your dad tell you?

359
00:27:26,125 --> 00:27:29,333
Not much, actually.
It's-it's why I'm asking.

360
00:27:31,833 --> 00:27:34,500
Gee, I don't know.

361
00:27:34,583 --> 00:27:37,250
Maybe the mashed potatoes
were a little better?

362
00:27:38,291 --> 00:27:41,208
That is what my dad used to say.

363
00:27:47,166 --> 00:27:48,708
Must be true then.

364
00:27:49,708 --> 00:27:51,791
It must be true.

365
00:28:06,208 --> 00:28:07,750
<i>Hello, Vault 33.</i>

366
00:28:07,833 --> 00:28:10,166
<i>In my first edict as overseer,</i>

367
00:28:10,250 --> 00:28:15,666
<i>I will be hosting a vault-wide meeting
about the future of Vault 32</i>

368
00:28:15,750 --> 00:28:18,333
<i>tomorrow at 10:00 a.m.</i>

369
00:28:18,416 --> 00:28:20,875
<i>See you there.</i>

370
00:28:41,541 --> 00:28:42,916
What?

371
00:28:46,458 --> 00:28:50,250
This isn't... real, right?

372
00:28:51,833 --> 00:28:55,291
You never heard
of the New California Republic?

373
00:28:55,375 --> 00:28:58,916
34,000 people lived here
after the war?

374
00:28:59,000 --> 00:29:00,000
Yeah.

375
00:29:01,541 --> 00:29:03,541
What about Reclamation Day?

376
00:29:07,458 --> 00:29:11,375
Th-The entire purpose of my vault was...

377
00:29:11,458 --> 00:29:13,375
to come up to the surface one day and...

378
00:29:14,791 --> 00:29:16,083
...and restart civilization.

379
00:29:16,166 --> 00:29:19,625
It's-it's Reclamation Day,
it's what keeps us all going and...

380
00:29:24,416 --> 00:29:26,000
It...

381
00:29:27,333 --> 00:29:30,000
It already h-happened without us.

382
00:29:36,083 --> 00:29:39,666
Well, if it makes you feel
any better, it didn't work out.

383
00:29:44,250 --> 00:29:45,958
Hey.

384
00:29:46,041 --> 00:29:47,708
Come.

385
00:30:48,333 --> 00:30:50,291
What happened?

386
00:30:57,000 --> 00:30:59,625
It's the same thing that always happens.

387
00:31:02,291 --> 00:31:05,500
Everyone wants to save
the world, they just...

388
00:31:07,500 --> 00:31:09,458
...they disagree on how.

389
00:31:11,125 --> 00:31:13,458
I wonder if anyone survived.

390
00:31:17,541 --> 00:31:19,291
I did.

391
00:31:41,875 --> 00:31:43,916
We should keep moving.

392
00:31:48,000 --> 00:31:49,208
Hey...

393
00:31:59,458 --> 00:32:03,041
Titus, this is more than just a graze.

394
00:32:03,125 --> 00:32:07,083
We have to get you something...
from somewhere.

395
00:32:10,458 --> 00:32:12,375
We need to get the head.

396
00:32:12,458 --> 00:32:14,375
The head can wait.

397
00:32:16,458 --> 00:32:18,041
Come on.

398
00:32:30,166 --> 00:32:32,416
Look.

399
00:32:46,125 --> 00:32:47,125
Hey.

400
00:32:47,208 --> 00:32:48,750
Wait.

401
00:32:51,875 --> 00:32:53,184
There could be anything in there.

402
00:32:53,208 --> 00:32:54,958
Yeah.

403
00:32:55,041 --> 00:32:56,750
Like a first aid kit.

404
00:33:02,791 --> 00:33:04,708
Lucy!

405
00:33:08,708 --> 00:33:10,708
Lucy!

406
00:33:35,333 --> 00:33:36,333
Lucy?

407
00:34:01,333 --> 00:34:03,333
Lucy?

408
00:34:28,625 --> 00:34:30,125
Lucy.

409
00:34:30,208 --> 00:34:32,458
Lucy!

410
00:34:56,875 --> 00:34:59,458
Thank you for coming, everyone.

411
00:34:59,541 --> 00:35:03,250
It is important to me for us all

412
00:35:03,333 --> 00:35:06,875
to see this place together.

413
00:35:06,958 --> 00:35:09,041
As a community.

414
00:35:09,125 --> 00:35:10,458
As a family.

415
00:35:11,666 --> 00:35:14,291
So that we can heal together

416
00:35:14,375 --> 00:35:17,250
and rebuild together.

417
00:35:17,333 --> 00:35:20,083
What is happening here?

418
00:35:20,166 --> 00:35:22,916
Now, I spoke with the overseer of Vault 31

419
00:35:23,000 --> 00:35:26,416
<i>and we agreed these vaults of ours</i>

420
00:35:26,500 --> 00:35:28,416
<i>are too sacred to leave empty.</i>

421
00:35:28,500 --> 00:35:32,541
<i>Which is why I am announcing
a resettling campaign.</i>

422
00:35:32,625 --> 00:35:35,375
<i>Some of us will stay home to rebuild 33.</i>

423
00:35:35,458 --> 00:35:38,833
<i>Others will be moving into Vault 32</i>

424
00:35:38,916 --> 00:35:41,375

Great job cleaning up.

447
00:37:24,000 --> 00:37:26,625
The raiders destroyed so much.

448
00:37:27,916 --> 00:37:30,500
But not our spirits.

449
00:37:34,375 --> 00:37:35,375
Betty?

450
00:37:39,083 --> 00:37:41,500
When my mother died,
what happened to her Pip-Boy?

451
00:37:43,500 --> 00:37:45,958
It was buried with her.

452
00:37:46,041 --> 00:37:48,208
How are you so sure?

453
00:37:51,625 --> 00:37:54,375
Because I buried her myself.

454
00:37:54,458 --> 00:37:57,958
Me and your father.

455
00:39:05,000 --> 00:39:06,708
Where are we?

456
00:39:06,791 --> 00:39:08,333
It's okay.

457
00:39:08,416 --> 00:39:10,416
We'll be all right.

458
00:39:17,625 --> 00:39:19,500

459
00:39:20,500 --> 00:39:23,333
We're in the best place in the world.

460
00:39:29,708 --> 00:39:31,708
