1
00:00:11,125 --> 00:00:13,125
You are my world.

2
00:00:14,333 --> 00:00:16,333
Where are you taking him?

3
00:00:17,625 --> 00:00:19,875
To the real world.
You should see it sometime.

4
00:00:19,958 --> 00:00:26,333
You can change the future
if you can bring me to Moldaver.

5
00:00:27,208 --> 00:00:28,958
- Just my head.
- Ow.

6
00:00:29,041 --> 00:00:31,500
<i>This is the only way
to get your dad back.</i>

7
00:00:31,583 --> 00:00:34,041
<i>Aspirant Dane?</i>

8
00:00:34,166 --> 00:00:35,375
You're aware of their injury?

9
00:00:36,291 --> 00:00:37,791
<i>Shoot it!</i>

10
00:00:37,875 --> 00:00:41,125
You stupid motherfucker,
you know this is all your fault.

11
00:00:41,208 --> 00:00:42,458
They'll kill you for this.

12
00:00:42,541 --> 00:00:43,851
<i>They don't have to find out.</i>

13
00:00:43,875 --> 00:00:45,125
It's the Brotherhood.

14
00:00:45,208 --> 00:00:47,416
<i>They'll find out.</i>

15
00:00:47,500 --> 00:00:50,041
They want a head, we give them a head.

16
00:00:50,125 --> 00:00:51,351
You're supposed to come with me.

17
00:00:51,375 --> 00:00:53,500
They're never gonna stop looking.
Trust me.

18
00:00:54,833 --> 00:00:58,291
<i>America has been locked
in a resource war.</i>

19
00:00:58,375 --> 00:01:01,125
<i>Vault-Tec bought the means
to end that war.</i>

20
00:01:01,208 --> 00:01:03,875
<i>Cold fusion. Infinite energy.</i>

21
00:01:03,958 --> 00:01:05,476
- Is-is that a...
- Fusion core?

22
00:01:05,500 --> 00:01:08,250
You don't see those around much
anymore, do you?

23
00:01:08,375 --> 00:01:12,333
What is the ultimate weapon
to destroy your competition?

24
00:01:12,416 --> 00:01:14,208
<i>It's time.</i>

25
00:01:14,291 --> 00:01:16,309
<i>You ever think
about working somewhere else?</i>

26
00:01:16,333 --> 00:01:18,166
Vault-Tec exists with or without me.

27
00:01:18,250 --> 00:01:20,650
It doesn't do anyone any good to complain
from the sidelines.

28
00:01:20,708 --> 00:01:24,000
- It's a listening device.
- You want me to spy on my wife?

29
00:01:25,291 --> 00:01:27,226
<i>When my mother died,
what happened to her Pip-Boy?</i>

30
00:01:27,250 --> 00:01:28,500
It was buried with her.

31
00:01:28,583 --> 00:01:30,458
<i>I buried her myself.</i>

32
00:01:30,541 --> 00:01:33,666
<i>Me... and your father.</i>

33
00:01:39,250 --> 00:01:40,250
<i>Hello?</i>

34
00:02:20,791 --> 00:02:21,833
Find me.

35
00:02:22,916 --> 00:02:24,250
I will.

36
00:02:45,041 --> 00:02:46,767
<i>Filly clear
for landing.</i>

37
00:02:46,791 --> 00:02:49,791
<i>The locals put up a fight, but so did we.</i>

38
00:03:56,541 --> 00:03:58,916
You're wearing the Knight's red.

39
00:04:00,541 --> 00:04:02,833
Where's your Knight?

40
00:04:05,875 --> 00:04:07,625
He's dead.

41
00:04:12,125 --> 00:04:16,250
This is not the first time
a Brother in your company

42
00:04:16,333 --> 00:04:18,875
has fallen into misfortune...

43
00:04:21,833 --> 00:04:23,375
...is it?

44
00:04:33,083 --> 00:04:36,333
I fear you lied then.

45
00:04:37,458 --> 00:04:39,875
No artifact, m'lord.

46
00:04:39,958 --> 00:04:42,791
Just as you lie now.

47
00:04:44,833 --> 00:04:46,666
Wait, wait, wait!

48
00:04:46,750 --> 00:04:49,875
Wait, wait, wait.

49
00:04:49,958 --> 00:04:51,583
Please, listen to me!

50
00:04:51,666 --> 00:04:54,500
I can get you the real head.

51
00:04:54,583 --> 00:04:56,083
Confess.

52
00:04:56,166 --> 00:04:58,458
Don't kill me
and I can lead you to it!

53
00:05:04,833 --> 00:05:07,250
I can help you!

54
00:05:07,333 --> 00:05:09,458
Please, m'lord.

55
00:05:10,583 --> 00:05:12,958
My injury was my own doing. Not his.

56
00:05:14,500 --> 00:05:17,625
Please...
Please, I know where the head is!

57
00:05:17,708 --> 00:05:19,916
For the sake of the Brotherhood,
please listen to him!

58
00:05:22,750 --> 00:05:25,208
Such a display of loyalty.

59
00:05:25,291 --> 00:05:28,666
Don't see that much anymore.

60
00:05:58,208 --> 00:06:02,250
You think you're the first
squire who coveted his Knight's armor?

61
00:06:05,583 --> 00:06:07,875
How did Titus die?

62
00:06:07,958 --> 00:06:10,291
He died running.

63
00:06:12,750 --> 00:06:15,750
The Brotherhood has lost its way.

64
00:06:17,625 --> 00:06:20,916
We once ruled the Wasteland...

65
00:06:23,916 --> 00:06:28,333
And yet power is taken, not given.

66
00:06:28,416 --> 00:06:31,208
A lesson you seem to have learned.

67
00:06:39,500 --> 00:06:43,208
So, if what you say is true,

68
00:06:43,291 --> 00:06:46,541
and you can lead us to the relic,

69
00:06:46,625 --> 00:06:50,166
then together, you and I,

70
00:06:50,250 --> 00:06:52,916
we will take power.

71
00:06:54,708 --> 00:06:57,333
And with it...

72
00:06:57,416 --> 00:07:00,250
we will start a new Brotherhood.

73
00:07:00,333 --> 00:07:06,708
With me as its head,
and the likes of you as its sword.

74
00:07:14,750 --> 00:07:18,708
Your entire life,
you've been looking for a home.

75
00:07:28,541 --> 00:07:31,166
Build one with me.

76
00:08:33,791 --> 00:08:35,041
It's her.

77
00:09:24,833 --> 00:09:26,750
Well, thank you for the ride.

78
00:09:26,833 --> 00:09:29,875
Well, it's the least I could do
after I bungled your oil change.

79
00:09:29,958 --> 00:09:32,375
Well, I appreciate you trying.

80
00:09:32,458 --> 00:09:34,958
You know, most guys with a ride this nice,

81
00:09:35,041 --> 00:09:37,833
they wouldn't be willing
to get their hands dirty.

82
00:09:41,041 --> 00:09:43,250
Okay.

83
00:09:43,333 --> 00:09:45,375
- I love you.
- Love you, too.

84
00:09:47,250 --> 00:09:49,125
- Have a great day.
- Thank you, Coop.

85
00:09:49,208 --> 00:09:50,625
Okay.

86
00:10:00,041 --> 00:10:01,458
Coop!

87
00:10:01,541 --> 00:10:03,500
Ah.

88
00:10:03,583 --> 00:10:06,208
- Good to see you, buddy.
- Yeah.

89
00:10:07,458 --> 00:10:10,416
- What's wrong?
- Uh, my Pip-Boy.

90
00:10:10,500 --> 00:10:14,583
It's been acting strange.
The transmitter is always activated...

91
00:10:14,666 --> 00:10:17,184
Well, maybe take it over to the boys
in IT, have them take a look...

92
00:10:17,208 --> 00:10:19,125
No, no, I can fix it myself.

93
00:10:19,208 --> 00:10:21,684
I just need to figure out where
the Pip-Boy is trying to transmit to...

94
00:10:21,708 --> 00:10:24,351
I-I'm heading out. I promised Janey
that I would teach her some roping.

95
00:10:24,375 --> 00:10:26,958
Oh, yeah? I don't have kids myself.

96
00:10:27,041 --> 00:10:29,059
But I do have a training program
for up-and-coming executives,

97
00:10:29,083 --> 00:10:30,559
and that's basically
the same thing.

98
00:10:30,583 --> 00:10:32,791
I imagine Barb told you about it?

99
00:10:34,750 --> 00:10:37,375
- Uh... no. No.
- Oh.

100
00:10:37,458 --> 00:10:38,666
Well, I call it Bud's Buds.

101
00:10:38,750 --> 00:10:40,851
The basic idea is
that the biggest obstacle to achievement

102
00:10:40,875 --> 00:10:42,625
has been the brevity
of the human lifespan.

103
00:10:42,708 --> 00:10:45,541
It's prevented us from working
on projects that require centuries,

104
00:10:45,625 --> 00:10:47,105
maybe even millennia, to see through.

105
00:10:47,166 --> 00:10:50,000
So ideally, Bud's Buds will keep
my project on track

106
00:10:50,083 --> 00:10:52,500
- centuries into the future. Nifty, huh?
- Bud.

107
00:10:52,583 --> 00:10:54,000
- We're getting late.
- Oh, yes.

108
00:10:54,083 --> 00:10:55,583
- Let's go.
- Big day today.

109
00:10:55,666 --> 00:10:57,625
Yeah.

110
00:10:57,708 --> 00:10:58,958
Good luck.

111
00:11:03,333 --> 00:11:07,333
<i>Hey, maybe, uh, maybe we could
all go to Café Cabana sometime?</i>

112
00:11:07,416 --> 00:11:08,750
<i>You, me and Coop?</i>

113
00:11:08,833 --> 00:11:10,208
<i>Oh! Sorry.</i>

114
00:11:10,291 --> 00:11:12,500
<i>Has your Pip-Boy
been acting strangely?</i>

115
00:11:12,583 --> 00:11:14,500
<i>No. Why?
What's wrong with yours?</i>

116
00:11:14,583 --> 00:11:16,291
<i>I'm not sure yet.</i>

117
00:11:17,875 --> 00:11:19,125
Fuck.

118
00:12:14,958 --> 00:12:16,166
Lucy.

119
00:12:17,166 --> 00:12:18,166
Dad.

120
00:12:30,458 --> 00:12:32,000
Welcome.

121
00:12:43,958 --> 00:12:45,375
Join us.

122
00:12:45,458 --> 00:12:48,041
It's my turn to host, isn't it?

123
00:12:54,291 --> 00:12:56,875
I've had a lot of time
to think about this moment.

124
00:12:59,708 --> 00:13:02,500
You wouldn't believe the things
that went through my head.

125
00:13:06,708 --> 00:13:08,166
One night, I...

126
00:13:08,250 --> 00:13:12,208
actually tried to stuff an old grenade
into the neck hole.

127
00:13:15,208 --> 00:13:17,500
Guess I...

128
00:13:17,583 --> 00:13:20,333
was gonna walk in here and...

129
00:13:20,416 --> 00:13:22,041
blow everybody up.

130
00:13:23,125 --> 00:13:24,541
But it's...

131
00:13:24,625 --> 00:13:27,166
not really how I was raised.

132
00:13:30,541 --> 00:13:32,291
So...

133
00:13:32,375 --> 00:13:34,125
if you don't mind,

134
00:13:34,208 --> 00:13:36,208
I'm gonna keep things civil.

135
00:13:41,208 --> 00:13:43,166
Brought you your friend.

136
00:13:43,250 --> 00:13:44,833
Just like he asked.

137
00:13:56,666 --> 00:13:59,083
Now, please...

138
00:14:00,083 --> 00:14:01,666
...give me my dad back.

139
00:14:04,166 --> 00:14:05,958
Very well.

140
00:14:12,958 --> 00:14:14,875
But, first...

141
00:14:17,208 --> 00:14:20,000
...what if I tell you
how I know your father?

142
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:22,833
Who he really is?

143
00:14:24,875 --> 00:14:26,833
No. Lucy,

144
00:14:26,916 --> 00:14:29,083
- don't listen to her.
- You think your father

145
00:14:29,166 --> 00:14:30,916
was born in a vault.

146
00:14:31,916 --> 00:14:33,666
Like you.

147
00:14:35,875 --> 00:14:38,208
<i>Like your brother.</i>

148
00:14:38,291 --> 00:14:40,017
<i>The key to the future of...</i>

149
00:14:40,041 --> 00:14:42,458
<i>- No, no, I'll get it this time.</i>
- Hello?

150
00:14:42,541 --> 00:14:44,458
<i>The key to the future of humanity...</i>

151
00:14:44,541 --> 00:14:45,875
<i>Oh!</i>

152
00:14:45,958 --> 00:14:47,638
<i>The-the-the key to the future of human...</i>

153
00:14:47,708 --> 00:14:49,083
<i>Oh, no.</i>

154
00:14:49,166 --> 00:14:50,583
<i>This is ridiculous.</i>

155
00:14:51,625 --> 00:14:53,017
<i>The key to the future of humanity...</i>

156
00:14:53,041 --> 00:14:55,583
<i>Nope. Try.</i>

157
00:14:55,666 --> 00:14:57,583
- Hello?
<i>- Nope.</i>

158
00:14:57,666 --> 00:14:59,416
<i>The key to the future of humanity...</i>

159
00:14:59,500 --> 00:15:01,750
<i>Ugh, I'm gonna get it.</i>

160
00:15:01,833 --> 00:15:03,267
<i>I'll get it. Don't you worry.</i>

161
00:15:03,291 --> 00:15:06,166
<i>The key to...
the key to the future of humanity...</i>

162
00:15:06,250 --> 00:15:08,041
<i>Oh!</i>

163
00:15:08,125 --> 00:15:10,375
<i>Now this is just ridiculous.</i>

164
00:15:11,375 --> 00:15:12,500
<i>A great game of the...</i>

165
00:15:12,583 --> 00:15:14,333
<i>Oh.</i>

166
00:15:14,416 --> 00:15:18,083
<i>All right, all right,
this one's it. I'll get it this time.</i>

167
00:15:18,166 --> 00:15:20,958
<i>The key to the future of humanity is a...</i>

168
00:15:21,041 --> 00:15:23,708
<i>Uh, nope. Just maybe I have to...</i>

169
00:15:23,791 --> 00:15:25,250
<i>Oh. Ah.</i>

170
00:15:25,333 --> 00:15:27,208
<i>Thank you, Betty.</i>

171
00:15:28,291 --> 00:15:29,458
<i>Wait, you're not Betty.</i>

172
00:15:29,541 --> 00:15:31,083
<i>Or Hank.</i>

173
00:15:32,583 --> 00:15:36,291
<i>You share only 50% of Hank MacLean's DNA.</i>

174
00:15:37,375 --> 00:15:38,666
I'm...

175
00:15:38,750 --> 00:15:40,000
- his son.
<i>- No.</i>

176
00:15:40,083 --> 00:15:42,041
<i>No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no!</i>

177
00:15:42,125 --> 00:15:43,250
What are you?

178
00:15:43,333 --> 00:15:45,666
<i>Initiate Protocol 53.</i>

179
00:15:51,750 --> 00:15:54,000
<i>Now, sorry, just hold still.</i>

180
00:15:54,083 --> 00:15:55,500
- Who are you?
<i>- Wait.</i>

181
00:15:55,583 --> 00:15:57,851
<i>Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
I won't answer your questions</i>

182
00:15:57,875 --> 00:15:59,750
<i>unless you let me inject you with this.</i>

183
00:16:01,291 --> 00:16:05,708
<i>All right, don't move.
The secret must be guarded.</i>

184
00:16:05,791 --> 00:16:07,208
<i>Don't-don't go in there.</i>

185
00:16:07,291 --> 00:16:08,708
<i>Don't you go in there!</i>

186
00:16:08,791 --> 00:16:11,000
<i>Don't read anything in there!
Or turn on the lights.</i>

187
00:16:11,083 --> 00:16:15,333
<i>Don't you access the info tree
or look at the terminal.</i>

188
00:16:15,416 --> 00:16:16,833
<i>Wait! Just...</i>

189
00:16:16,916 --> 00:16:19,583
<i>stay right there. Stop.</i>

190
00:16:19,666 --> 00:16:21,666
<i>I'm coming!</i>

191
00:16:21,750 --> 00:16:23,500
What is this place?

192
00:16:25,333 --> 00:16:27,625
Any idea when Barb will be back?

193
00:16:27,708 --> 00:16:29,125
I'm sorry. She's in a meeting.

194
00:16:29,208 --> 00:16:31,500
Something about vertical integration or...

195
00:16:31,583 --> 00:16:32,791
Above my pay grade.

196
00:16:32,875 --> 00:16:35,125
- Mine, too.
- Ha.

197
00:16:36,541 --> 00:16:38,333
By the way, Mr. Howard,

198
00:16:38,416 --> 00:16:40,666
there's a new guy who works with Barb.

199
00:16:40,750 --> 00:16:42,208
Henry.

200
00:16:42,291 --> 00:16:44,375
He's a really big fan of yours.

201
00:16:44,458 --> 00:16:46,541
Yes. Henry.

202
00:16:46,625 --> 00:16:48,958
He has called the house a few times.

203
00:16:49,041 --> 00:16:50,416
Do you mind if I bring him by?

204
00:16:50,500 --> 00:16:52,458
Just to meet you for a moment?

205
00:16:52,541 --> 00:16:53,791
Of course.

206
00:16:53,875 --> 00:16:55,250
Yeah. Always happy to meet a fan.

207
00:17:08,833 --> 00:17:11,625
<i>All of our work,
everything that we've accomplished</i>

208
00:17:11,708 --> 00:17:14,916
<i>is the result
of this fruit-bearing collaboration</i>

209
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:18,750
<i>between like-minded corporations
that make America great.</i>

210
00:17:20,916 --> 00:17:23,750
On behalf of everyone here at Vault-Tec...

211
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:26,625
...welcome.

212
00:17:31,833 --> 00:17:34,416
Let's call this what it is, Bud.

213
00:17:34,500 --> 00:17:36,583
Your sales aren't up to snuff,

214
00:17:36,666 --> 00:17:38,208
and you need money.

215
00:17:38,291 --> 00:17:41,833
You're one to talk, Freddy boy.
You could lose money running a casino.

216
00:17:45,416 --> 00:17:47,291
<i>Our sales are fine.</i>

217
00:17:47,375 --> 00:17:50,125
<i>Sure, rumors of the peace
negotiations have set us back a bit,</i>

218
00:17:50,208 --> 00:17:53,125
<i>but we're here
to offer you an opportunity.</i>

219
00:17:53,208 --> 00:17:55,500
<i>We'd like to collaborate
on some of our vaults.</i>

220
00:17:55,583 --> 00:17:57,666
<i>I-I don't get the vaults.</i>

221
00:17:57,750 --> 00:17:59,125
<i>When it's time to come out,</i>

222
00:17:59,208 --> 00:18:02,708
what if people are still alive
on the surface?

223
00:18:02,791 --> 00:18:04,500
They'll be Stone Age creatures.

224
00:18:04,583 --> 00:18:07,250
Probably eat whoever
steps out of your vaults.

225
00:18:07,333 --> 00:18:08,583
That isn't an issue.

226
00:18:08,666 --> 00:18:11,791
Our vaults have the resources
to survive for centuries.

227
00:18:11,875 --> 00:18:14,583
Meanwhile, our competitors... you know,

228
00:18:14,666 --> 00:18:18,458
every other human who isn't us...
will be dead on the surface.

229
00:18:19,750 --> 00:18:21,291
<i>Because after all,</i>

230
00:18:21,375 --> 00:18:24,791
what is the ultimate weapon
of mass destruction?

231
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:30,125
Time.

232
00:18:30,208 --> 00:18:31,625
<i>Time.</i>

233
00:18:32,708 --> 00:18:35,458
Time is the apex predator.

234
00:18:35,541 --> 00:18:37,791
And in the event of an incident,

235
00:18:37,875 --> 00:18:42,500
time is the weapon with which
we will defeat all of our enemies.

236
00:18:42,583 --> 00:18:46,041
<i>That is how we will win
the great game of capitalism.</i>

237
00:18:46,125 --> 00:18:48,666
<i>Not by outfighting anyone,</i>

238
00:18:48,750 --> 00:18:50,166
but by outliving them.

239
00:18:50,250 --> 00:18:51,875
Even if you outlive

240
00:18:51,958 --> 00:18:56,083
all external threats,
here's my problem with the vaults.

241
00:18:56,166 --> 00:18:58,291
You confine a bunch of rats

242
00:18:58,375 --> 00:19:01,166
in a nest for a long time,
they end up eating each other.

243
00:19:01,250 --> 00:19:03,208
So who's to say your rats
are gonna survive

244
00:19:03,291 --> 00:19:06,041
better than those animals on the surface?

245
00:19:06,125 --> 00:19:08,267
And you still haven't addressed
the fundamental question...

246
00:19:08,291 --> 00:19:09,476
That is a little shortsighted,
I would say.

247
00:19:09,500 --> 00:19:10,851
I don't need rats
for people on the surface.

248
00:19:30,458 --> 00:19:34,333
If I could perhaps
refocus the conversation.

249
00:19:38,833 --> 00:19:41,750
Come on, Barb. Set 'em straight.

250
00:19:42,916 --> 00:19:46,083
When I think about the future,

251
00:19:46,166 --> 00:19:49,291
I think about my daughter...

252
00:19:49,375 --> 00:19:51,041
Janey.

253
00:19:53,250 --> 00:19:54,750
<i>How do I provide her</i>

254
00:19:54,833 --> 00:19:56,916
with a better future?

255
00:19:57,000 --> 00:20:00,541
That's what we've invited you here
to discuss.

256
00:20:00,625 --> 00:20:02,333
Yes.

257
00:20:02,416 --> 00:20:04,875
<i>And how do we design</i>

258
00:20:04,958 --> 00:20:10,250
our vault societies
so our children have that better future?

259
00:20:10,333 --> 00:20:12,750
I suggest we hedge our bets.

260
00:20:12,833 --> 00:20:15,541
<i>Wait!
I am the Overseer here!</i>

261
00:20:15,625 --> 00:20:17,916
<i>My orders must be followed!</i>

262
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:21,416
<i>Why isn't this working?
This is conflict resolution 101.</i>

263
00:20:21,500 --> 00:20:23,166
Where's the rest of the vault?

264
00:20:23,250 --> 00:20:25,333
<i>This is the rest of the vault.</i>

265
00:20:25,416 --> 00:20:28,250
Is this where my dad's from?

266
00:20:28,333 --> 00:20:30,416
<i>You'll never find out.</i>

267
00:20:31,458 --> 00:20:33,333
<i>Oh. He's gonna find out.</i>

268
00:20:51,958 --> 00:20:54,166
<i>These are Bud's Buds.</i>

269
00:20:54,250 --> 00:20:58,625
<i>My Buds. America outsourced the survival
of this country to the private sector.</i>

270
00:20:58,708 --> 00:21:01,291
<i>But it would have been insane
to keep a failed nation alive.</i>

271
00:21:01,375 --> 00:21:04,583
<i>So, we kept Vault-Tec alive instead.</i>

272
00:21:04,666 --> 00:21:08,083
<i>A well-trained staff
of highly supervised junior executives</i>

273
00:21:08,166 --> 00:21:09,766
<i>from my own assistant training program.</i>

274
00:21:11,083 --> 00:21:15,000
<i>Because the future of humanity
comes down to one word:</i>

275
00:21:15,083 --> 00:21:17,291
<i>Management.</i>

276
00:21:18,833 --> 00:21:21,250
Bud here has an idea for

277
00:21:21,333 --> 00:21:23,541
three interconnected vaults.

278
00:21:23,625 --> 00:21:27,291
But we need more ideas.
We need your ideas.

279
00:21:27,375 --> 00:21:31,500
Because it was the spirit of competition
that made our companies great,

280
00:21:31,583 --> 00:21:37,583
and I propose we bring that same spirit
of competition to our solution.

281
00:21:41,083 --> 00:21:45,833
We have over a hundred vaults
spread across America.

282
00:21:46,833 --> 00:21:50,291
Enough for each of you to claim several,

283
00:21:50,375 --> 00:21:53,416
where you can play out your own ideas

284
00:21:53,500 --> 00:21:57,208
for how to create the perfect conditions
for humanity.

285
00:21:57,291 --> 00:22:00,541
Whatever you want to do,
no one needs to know.

286
00:22:03,291 --> 00:22:05,083
And may the best idea win.

287
00:22:09,833 --> 00:22:14,250
So what's Vault 32 and 33?
Just people to be controlled?

288
00:22:14,333 --> 00:22:18,125
<i>What? No! When you put it like that,
it sounds downright morally questionable.</i>

289
00:22:18,208 --> 00:22:23,041
<i>They're our breeding pool,
the ultimate expression of HR R&D.</i>

290
00:22:23,125 --> 00:22:27,125
<i>Genetically selected to breed with my Buds
to create a class of super managers.</i>

291
00:22:27,208 --> 00:22:30,666
<i>People with positivity,
people who make lemonade.</i>

292
00:22:30,750 --> 00:22:34,333
<i>People who will inherit the Earth
after we've wiped the surface clean.</i>

293
00:22:38,083 --> 00:22:40,625
We wiped the surface clean?

294
00:22:40,708 --> 00:22:42,666
<i>We could intentionally</i>

295
00:22:42,750 --> 00:22:49,000
overcrowd a vault so people have
to compete to survive inside it.

296
00:22:49,083 --> 00:22:53,166
We have been developing a robot
that delivers milk to the front door.

297
00:22:53,250 --> 00:22:56,166
It's quite intelligent. I would like
to see a vault governed by it.

298
00:22:56,250 --> 00:23:00,083
What about using a vault
to develop a super-mutant soldier

299
00:23:00,166 --> 00:23:01,875
using illegal immigrants?

300
00:23:01,958 --> 00:23:04,666
<i>We could pump
psychotropic drugs into the air supply.</i>

301
00:23:04,750 --> 00:23:06,958
<i>We could separate
parents and children,</i>

302
00:23:07,041 --> 00:23:09,166
<i>and only the smartest kids
reach adulthood.</i>

303
00:23:09,250 --> 00:23:11,083
<i>It's a fun idea.</i>

304
00:23:11,166 --> 00:23:15,208
There's a lot of earning potential
with the end of the world.

305
00:23:15,291 --> 00:23:18,875
But we're talking
about making a significant investment

306
00:23:18,958 --> 00:23:21,000
based on a hypothetical.

307
00:23:21,083 --> 00:23:23,333
How can you guarantee results?

308
00:23:24,333 --> 00:23:26,583
By dropping the bomb ourselves.

309
00:23:31,958 --> 00:23:33,375
Mr. Howard?

310
00:23:35,583 --> 00:23:37,125
Mr. Howard?

311
00:23:39,208 --> 00:23:41,916
Everything all right, Mr. Howard?

312
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:45,541
Uh, fine.
I'm-I'm... I'm-I'm fine, Betty.

313
00:23:46,875 --> 00:23:48,916
He is so excited to meet you.

314
00:23:52,208 --> 00:23:55,583
A nuclear event would be a tragedy...

315
00:23:55,666 --> 00:23:58,416
but also, an opportunity.

316
00:23:58,500 --> 00:24:01,541
Perhaps the greatest opportunity
in history.

317
00:24:01,625 --> 00:24:06,250
Because when we are the only ones left,
there will be no one to fight.

318
00:24:08,291 --> 00:24:10,666
A true monopoly.

319
00:24:10,750 --> 00:24:12,500
Mr. Howard.

320
00:24:12,583 --> 00:24:15,125
Huge fan. I'm Henry, but, uh,

321
00:24:15,208 --> 00:24:17,208
everyone calls me Hank.

322
00:24:18,666 --> 00:24:20,291
Wow.

323
00:24:24,333 --> 00:24:28,208
<i>Your father has been around
for a very long time.</i>

324
00:24:33,333 --> 00:24:35,333
<i>Part of an organization</i>

325
00:24:35,416 --> 00:24:38,583
<i>that thought they had the answers
to all the world's problems.</i>

326
00:24:42,041 --> 00:24:44,166
<i>You know, that scene?</i>

327
00:24:44,250 --> 00:24:46,500
That scene where
you shoot Joey Toro in the face?

328
00:24:48,291 --> 00:24:51,708
<i>Feo, fuerte y formal.</i>

329
00:24:51,791 --> 00:24:57,000
<i>This is our chance
to make war obsolete.</i>

330
00:24:57,083 --> 00:25:02,208
<i>Because in our current societal
configuration, which took shape without</i>

331
00:25:02,291 --> 00:25:05,583
intentional guidance, we have friction.

332
00:25:06,958 --> 00:25:09,625
We have conflict, and we have war.

333
00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:14,083
And war, well...

334
00:25:19,916 --> 00:25:22,125
War never changes.

335
00:25:27,083 --> 00:25:29,833
I was just wondering,
if-if... if you don't mind,

336
00:25:29,916 --> 00:25:33,958
um, I hate to be that guy, but, do you
think you could give me an autograph?

337
00:25:36,958 --> 00:25:39,541
He never told you
where he's really from,

338
00:25:39,625 --> 00:25:41,750
when he's from.

339
00:25:42,750 --> 00:25:45,750
He never told your mother, either.

340
00:25:55,833 --> 00:25:57,666
What do you know about my mother?

341
00:25:58,916 --> 00:26:01,416
She was like you.

342
00:26:01,500 --> 00:26:04,875
She was kind, loving.

343
00:26:04,958 --> 00:26:06,375
Curious.

344
00:26:06,458 --> 00:26:09,083
Isn't that why you came
to the surface really?

345
00:26:09,166 --> 00:26:12,041
Partly to rescue your father, but...

346
00:26:12,125 --> 00:26:14,541
to know why I took him?

347
00:26:35,916 --> 00:26:38,000
Thank you.

348
00:26:45,250 --> 00:26:47,708
Wait. Dane, they're sending you?

349
00:26:47,791 --> 00:26:50,083
Punishment for what I did to myself.

350
00:26:51,166 --> 00:26:52,166
Hey.

351
00:26:54,375 --> 00:26:56,017
I was just scared of going into the Wilds.

352
00:26:56,041 --> 00:26:59,041
I had no idea
they'd blame you for it. I...

353
00:27:00,333 --> 00:27:01,750
I'm sorry.

354
00:27:04,833 --> 00:27:06,541
Don't be.

355
00:27:06,625 --> 00:27:09,208
I was meant to go on that mission.

356
00:27:11,458 --> 00:27:13,250
I met someone.

357
00:27:13,333 --> 00:27:16,291
But right now, she's walking into danger.

358
00:27:16,375 --> 00:27:18,500
That's why you came back.

359
00:27:18,583 --> 00:27:20,583
To rescue her.

360
00:27:21,750 --> 00:27:23,375
I'm leaving with her.

361
00:27:23,458 --> 00:27:25,500
I am going back to where she came from.

362
00:27:25,583 --> 00:27:30,833
A vault. It's a place
that's peaceful... and safe.

363
00:27:30,916 --> 00:27:32,666
Where nobody ever goes to war.

364
00:27:34,458 --> 00:27:36,666
What?

365
00:27:36,750 --> 00:27:39,000
- Maggots, clear out!
- Yes, sir!

366
00:27:44,250 --> 00:27:46,500
There's nowhere safe, Max.

367
00:27:46,583 --> 00:27:48,875
And there's no leaving.

368
00:27:48,958 --> 00:27:50,541
I wish there was.

369
00:28:33,000 --> 00:28:35,291
Rose was so clever.

370
00:28:35,375 --> 00:28:37,416
Like you.

371
00:28:38,791 --> 00:28:42,458
Lucy, your mother discovered

372
00:28:42,541 --> 00:28:45,541
that something was siphoning
the vault's water away.

373
00:28:48,166 --> 00:28:50,125
From that one clue,

374
00:28:50,208 --> 00:28:52,958
she deduced that maybe...

375
00:28:53,041 --> 00:28:55,583
civilization had returned to the surface.

376
00:29:02,208 --> 00:29:04,583
When she told her husband,

377
00:29:04,666 --> 00:29:07,791
he said it was a ridiculous idea,

378
00:29:07,875 --> 00:29:10,041
and that she should tell no one.

379
00:29:10,125 --> 00:29:12,833
Lucy, let's go. Let's...

380
00:29:12,916 --> 00:29:17,875
And that's when she realized
that her husband, the Overseer,

381
00:29:17,958 --> 00:29:19,416
was hiding things.

382
00:29:19,500 --> 00:29:21,625
Lucy, let's go.
Let's get out of here.

383
00:29:21,708 --> 00:29:23,958
So she ran away.

384
00:29:24,041 --> 00:29:25,958
Like you did, Lucy.

385
00:29:28,166 --> 00:29:30,958
<i>And took her children.</i>

386
00:29:31,041 --> 00:29:33,750
And she found this wonderful city

387
00:29:33,833 --> 00:29:36,500
that was everything
the vaults had promised to be.

388
00:29:36,583 --> 00:29:38,958
<i>She is lying!</i>

389
00:29:39,041 --> 00:29:40,083
<i>But then,</i>

390
00:29:40,166 --> 00:29:42,625
her husband came after her.

391
00:29:42,708 --> 00:29:46,375
And when she decided not to return home,

392
00:29:46,458 --> 00:29:48,208
he took the children.

393
00:29:51,250 --> 00:29:54,500
And he burned that city to the ground.

394
00:29:59,500 --> 00:30:01,166
Shady Sands.

395
00:30:01,250 --> 00:30:02,666
She's lying, Lucy.

396
00:30:04,250 --> 00:30:06,875
<i>That's how
Vault-Tec deals with competition.</i>

397
00:30:06,958 --> 00:30:10,000
<i>Just like they did 200 years ago.</i>

398
00:30:34,166 --> 00:30:36,000
Lucy?

399
00:30:36,083 --> 00:30:39,000
What you brought me is cold fusion.

400
00:30:39,083 --> 00:30:40,625
It's limitless energy.

401
00:30:40,708 --> 00:30:42,250
- Lucy?
- And we can build...

402
00:30:42,333 --> 00:30:44,000
- She's a murderer.
- ...our own world.

403
00:30:44,083 --> 00:30:46,083
- Lucy, look at me.
- It could be a better world.

404
00:30:46,166 --> 00:30:48,184
- It has clean water and medicine...
- She invaded our home.

405
00:30:48,208 --> 00:30:49,458
<i>...and power.</i>

406
00:30:49,541 --> 00:30:50,875
<i>- But for everyone.
- Lucy?</i>

407
00:30:50,958 --> 00:30:52,434
- Because when Vault-Tec...
- She killed...

408
00:30:52,458 --> 00:30:54,142
- ...bought my research...
- ...our people...

409
00:30:54,166 --> 00:30:56,250
...they made it proprietary,

410
00:30:56,333 --> 00:30:59,000
so only a trusted Vault-Tec minion

411
00:30:59,083 --> 00:31:03,833
- can activate cold fusion.
- Do not listen to her.

412
00:31:04,875 --> 00:31:06,833
All I need

413
00:31:06,916 --> 00:31:08,916
is for him to give me the code.

414
00:31:09,000 --> 00:31:12,000
Lucy, look at me!

415
00:31:12,083 --> 00:31:13,416
Look at me!

416
00:31:13,500 --> 00:31:14,875
Lucy!

417
00:31:27,125 --> 00:31:28,583
My mother.

418
00:31:31,916 --> 00:31:33,958
What happened to her?

419
00:31:36,833 --> 00:31:39,250
I think you know.

420
00:31:58,458 --> 00:31:59,541
<i>Lucy?</i>

421
00:32:25,541 --> 00:32:28,625
Lucy?

422
00:32:28,708 --> 00:32:30,708
She's lying, Lucy.

423
00:32:35,250 --> 00:32:37,416
Just give her the code.

424
00:32:53,208 --> 00:32:55,250
Give her the code.

425
00:33:06,208 --> 00:33:08,208
Give her the code, Dad.

426
00:35:04,416 --> 00:35:06,934
Well, it was great meeting you.
I actually have to get back home.

427
00:35:06,958 --> 00:35:09,750
<i>You can't go home,
son of Hank.</i>

428
00:35:11,041 --> 00:35:12,916
No.

429
00:35:15,000 --> 00:35:16,875
<i>Not with what you've learned.</i>

430
00:35:19,416 --> 00:35:22,541
So you're just...
you're just gonna keep me here?

431
00:35:22,625 --> 00:35:24,916
<i>Just until we're all ready
to go to the surface.</i>

432
00:35:25,000 --> 00:35:26,458
That could be hundreds of years.

433
00:35:26,541 --> 00:35:30,125
<i>True. That's why I'd suggest
you wait it out in your dad's pod.</i>

434
00:35:30,208 --> 00:35:32,333
<i>Unless you want to starve to death.</i>

435
00:35:32,416 --> 00:35:36,125
<i>Not much food in here,
except the occasional very large bug.</i>

436
00:35:36,208 --> 00:35:39,291
<i>I'd certainly put myself
to sleep if I could.</i>

437
00:36:15,416 --> 00:36:18,291
I did what was necessary...

438
00:36:20,208 --> 00:36:22,208
...to save our people.

439
00:36:24,083 --> 00:36:25,666
And that woman over there...

440
00:36:28,166 --> 00:36:30,375
She's no different than me.

441
00:36:59,166 --> 00:37:01,666
<i>Incoming aircraft.</i>

442
00:37:03,250 --> 00:37:04,833
The Brotherhood?

443
00:37:04,916 --> 00:37:06,791
Barricade the doors!

444
00:37:07,875 --> 00:37:10,000
Don't let anyone in here!

445
00:37:10,083 --> 00:37:11,333
Let's move!

446
00:37:11,416 --> 00:37:14,250
Move out, move out, move out.

447
00:37:17,041 --> 00:37:18,666
Lucy?

448
00:37:18,750 --> 00:37:20,833
I loved your mother.

449
00:37:23,041 --> 00:37:26,041
But she stopped being your mother
when she left home.

450
00:37:27,875 --> 00:37:31,750
When she took you into danger.

451
00:38:06,416 --> 00:38:08,666
Incoming!

452
00:38:13,250 --> 00:38:14,791
You've seen what it's like up here.

453
00:38:25,375 --> 00:38:29,333
<i>Everyone equally afraid,
equally miserable.</i>

454
00:38:37,125 --> 00:38:40,333
<i>Forced to do horrible things
in order to survive.</i>

455
00:38:41,375 --> 00:38:43,541
Lucy...

456
00:38:43,625 --> 00:38:47,125
I had to make a choice.

457
00:38:49,541 --> 00:38:54,208
<i>Between their violent world
and our peaceful one.</i>

458
00:38:57,125 --> 00:39:02,083
And I believe, Lucy, I know
I made the right choice.

is factions endlessly fighting,

endlessly at war,
then what is the solution

475
00:40:23,291 --> 00:40:25,291
but to get rid of the factions?

476
00:40:25,375 --> 00:40:28,458
To make the world us,

477
00:40:28,541 --> 00:40:30,166

00:41:45,250 --> 00:41:49,291
Well, I know 'cause,
well, I used to wear one

496
00:41:49,375 --> 00:41:51,041
back in the day.

497
00:41:51,125 --> 00:41:53,625
There was only one problem with it.

498
00:41:53,708 --> 00:41:55,916
There was a flaw

499
00:41:56,000 --> 00:41:59,875
in the welding just below the chest plate.

500
00:42:01,291 --> 00:42:03,791
I wonder if they fixed that
in this new model?

501
00:42:13,000 --> 00:42:15,833
I guess not.

502
00:42:27,583 --> 00:42:28,625
Did you get him?

503
00:42:28,708 --> 00:42:30,166
I can't see shit.

504
00:42:39,708 --> 00:42:41,208
Find that fucking ghoul.

505
00:42:55,708 --> 00:42:59,875
Open the door, Lucy.
Open the door, let's go home.

506
00:43:01,833 --> 00:43:03,416
Let's go home.

507
00:43:09,625 --> 00:43:10,875
Let's go home.

508
00:43:24,958 --> 00:43:26,750
Lucy.

509
00:43:33,000 --> 00:43:35,958
Please. Open the door, Lucy.

510
00:43:56,625 --> 00:43:59,958
Lucy. Lucy.

511
00:44:00,041 --> 00:44:01,333
Lucy?

512
00:44:01,416 --> 00:44:03,583
- Lucy.
- Hey. Hey.

513
00:44:03,666 --> 00:44:05,750
I'm her father.
Can you get us out of here?

514
00:44:08,666 --> 00:44:11,750
- Lucy, let's go. Come on, we got to get out of here.
- Wait. No.

515
00:44:11,833 --> 00:44:13,666
Not with him.

516
00:44:13,750 --> 00:44:15,250
Why not with him? What do you mean?

517
00:44:15,333 --> 00:44:17,708
Because it was him. He...

518
00:44:17,791 --> 00:44:19,625
- What?
- It was him.

519
00:44:19,708 --> 00:44:21,625
- What was him?
- He...

520
00:44:22,916 --> 00:44:25,291
Lucy, what?

521
00:44:27,291 --> 00:44:29,291
Shady Sands.

522
00:44:55,833 --> 00:44:58,000
It was him.

523
00:45:02,625 --> 00:45:04,333
I'm sorry.

524
00:45:10,791 --> 00:45:14,125
Lucy. You're coming with me.

525
00:45:17,250 --> 00:45:18,833
No!

526
00:45:20,750 --> 00:45:24,708
Hey, Max. Max. Max, wake up.

527
00:45:36,833 --> 00:45:39,625
You see what this place does to people?

528
00:45:41,166 --> 00:45:43,166
I'm your father, Lucy.

529
00:45:46,958 --> 00:45:49,708
You came all this way for me.

530
00:45:55,666 --> 00:45:57,750
You're not gonna hurt me.

531
00:46:08,958 --> 00:46:12,083
God...

532
00:46:12,166 --> 00:46:15,083
Oh, you want another autograph,
Young Henry?

533
00:46:16,375 --> 00:46:20,708
<i>Feo, fuerte y formal.</i>

534
00:46:23,083 --> 00:46:26,708
When your daughter said her last name
was MacLean, well,

535
00:46:26,791 --> 00:46:30,708
I just couldn't believe
it was the MacLean.

536
00:46:30,791 --> 00:46:34,083
Hell, this kid used to pick up
my wife's dry cleaning.

537
00:46:35,291 --> 00:46:38,250
Now, I've waited over 200 years

538
00:46:38,333 --> 00:46:42,500
to ask somebody one question.

539
00:46:43,833 --> 00:46:46,041
Where's my fucking family?

540
00:47:05,875 --> 00:47:07,333
Yeah.

541
00:47:11,416 --> 00:47:12,791
Hey.

542
00:47:12,875 --> 00:47:17,583
Max. Hey, hey. Hey, Max. Max, wake up.

543
00:47:17,666 --> 00:47:19,291
Come on, wake up.

544
00:47:19,375 --> 00:47:22,708
Wake up! God.

545
00:47:22,791 --> 00:47:25,625
Come on. Come on!

546
00:47:25,708 --> 00:47:29,000
Come on! Please!

547
00:47:44,375 --> 00:47:47,875
War never changes.

548
00:47:47,958 --> 00:47:51,125
You look out at this Wasteland,

549
00:47:51,208 --> 00:47:53,333
looks like chaos.

550
00:47:57,541 --> 00:47:59,958
But there's always somebody
behind the wheel.

551
00:48:01,791 --> 00:48:04,208
And that's who I want to talk to.

552
00:48:06,583 --> 00:48:08,333
That's where your daddy is headed.

553
00:48:08,416 --> 00:48:10,333
But you let him go.

554
00:48:10,416 --> 00:48:15,208
Well, it's easier to track a stuck
pig than to ask it where it's off to.

555
00:48:18,750 --> 00:48:20,833
You want to know
how I know your daddy, don't you?

556
00:48:20,916 --> 00:48:25,541
Let's just say that everything
about your whole little world

557
00:48:25,625 --> 00:48:27,708
was decided over 200 years ago.

558
00:48:31,958 --> 00:48:34,583
Now, you can stay here with him,

559
00:48:34,666 --> 00:48:37,125
but when his tin can soldier friends
take this place...

560
00:48:37,208 --> 00:48:39,916
and they gonna take this place...

561
00:48:40,000 --> 00:48:42,875
they will kill you and everybody here.

562
00:48:53,250 --> 00:48:56,083
Or you could come meet your makers.

563
00:49:45,416 --> 00:49:46,875
You coming?

564
00:49:57,250 --> 00:49:58,583
Hey.

565
00:50:01,250 --> 00:50:02,416
Get up.

566
00:50:07,375 --> 00:50:09,125
Max.

567
00:50:12,000 --> 00:50:13,541
I'll find you.

568
00:50:35,833 --> 00:50:37,416
Okey-dokey.

569
00:51:15,125 --> 00:51:16,291
Lucy.

570
00:51:23,250 --> 00:51:24,541
Lucy.

571
00:51:40,291 --> 00:51:41,458
Lucy.

572
00:51:56,500 --> 00:51:58,708
Rose.

573
00:52:51,958 --> 00:52:54,583
We did it, Rose.

574
00:53:34,875 --> 00:53:38,833
What do you suppose your Brotherhood
would do with infinite power?

575
00:53:44,041 --> 00:53:48,208
Maybe you can stop them. Maybe you can't.

576
00:53:51,041 --> 00:53:53,291
Maybe all you can do is try.

577
00:54:22,125 --> 00:54:24,041
Is that their leader?

578
00:54:28,083 --> 00:54:29,916
You killed her.

579
00:54:30,000 --> 00:54:32,958
No. Dane.

580
00:54:33,041 --> 00:54:36,416
All hail Maximus!
That shalt be Knight hereafter!

581
00:54:36,500 --> 00:54:39,250
All hail Knight Maximus!

582
00:54:39,333 --> 00:54:43,750
All hail Knight Maximus!
All hail Knight Maximus!

583
00:54:43,833 --> 00:54:46,291
All hail Knight Maximus!

584
00:54:46,375 --> 00:54:49,958
All hail Knight Maximus!
All hail Knight Maximus!

585
00:54:50,041 --> 00:54:52,250
All hail Knight Maximus!

586
00:54:52,333 --> 00:54:55,208
All hail Knight Maximus!
