<i>Ain't much stays clean

2
00:00:19,750 --> 00:00:20,958
<i>You'll see.</i>

3
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:24,200
<i>I don't think it's our job
to help these people.</i>

4
00:00:24,750 --> 00:00:25,750
<i>They're murderers.</i>

5
00:00:25,791 --> 00:00:27,375
So what do you propose we do?

6
00:00:27,458 --> 00:00:29,083
We can do what they would've done to us.

7
00:00:29,166 --> 00:00:30,500
Wow.

8
00:00:30,583 --> 00:00:32,500
They killed my husband.

9
00:00:32,541 --> 00:00:35,041
<i>If your father were here, he'd...</i>

10
00:00:35,166 --> 00:00:36,791
he'd do the right thing.

11
00:00:36,875 --> 00:00:39,166
You okay?

12
00:00:39,250 --> 00:00:41,226
<i>The whole
"opening the vault door for Lucy" thing</i>

13
00:00:41,250 --> 00:00:43,125
<i>didn't sit too well
with the council, so...</i>

14
00:00:43,208 --> 00:00:46,375
I guess I'm not Gate-Keeper anymore.

15
00:00:46,458 --> 00:00:48,500
<i>I need the head.</i>

16
00:00:48,583 --> 00:00:49,976
It's the only way
I can get my father back.

17
00:00:51,208 --> 00:00:53,041
<i>You can't treat people like this!</i>

18
00:00:54,208 --> 00:00:55,916
<i>Yeah, why is that?</i>

19
00:00:57,125 --> 00:00:59,416
Because of the Golden Rule.

20
00:00:59,500 --> 00:01:01,791
<i>Wasteland's got
its own golden rule.</i>

21
00:01:01,875 --> 00:01:06,208

Hey, Rog.

Hey. Hey.

47
00:03:07,833 --> 00:03:09,625
Fancy seeing you out here.

48
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:13,583
You out for that bounty, too, huh?

49
00:03:13,666 --> 00:03:15,166
Yep.

50
00:03:23,500 --> 00:03:26,083
Oh, shit.

51
00:03:27,583 --> 00:03:29,875
- How you feeling?
- Oh...

52
00:03:33,583 --> 00:03:39,125
You know... it's hard out here.

53
00:03:39,208 --> 00:03:41,875
Dang smoothies can be so unkind.

54
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:46,125
I see you got a smoothie of your own.

55
00:03:52,375 --> 00:03:54,375
You're turning.

56
00:03:54,458 --> 00:03:57,333
Yeah. Yeah, maybe.

57
00:03:57,416 --> 00:03:59,416
Maybe.

58
00:03:59,500 --> 00:04:03,416
Hey, you-you don't happen
to have any vials, do you?

59
00:04:05,750 --> 00:04:09,625
Just one little puff
and I'll be back on my feet.

60
00:04:09,708 --> 00:04:11,708
You know I'm good for it.

61
00:04:12,791 --> 00:04:14,916
I'm sorry, Roger. I'm all out.

62
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:17,708
That's okay. That's okay.

63
00:04:17,750 --> 00:04:22,666
Though, um, you and your
smooth-faced friend, you, um...

64
00:04:22,750 --> 00:04:27,541
might want to clear out...
before things get ugly.

65
00:04:31,416 --> 00:04:33,416
I did okay.

66
00:04:35,625 --> 00:04:37,750
Twenty-eight years
since I first started showing.

67
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:46,041
Oh, hell.

68
00:04:48,125 --> 00:04:49,708
Not as long as you, though.

69
00:04:49,791 --> 00:04:52,250
You've outlasted us all.

70
00:04:52,333 --> 00:04:55,125
How long since
you first started wastelanding?

71
00:04:55,208 --> 00:04:57,458
A long time.

72
00:04:58,500 --> 00:05:00,083
That's a lot of vials.

73
00:05:00,166 --> 00:05:02,583
Well, I've always been good

74
00:05:02,666 --> 00:05:04,166
at making money, Roger.

75
00:05:07,541 --> 00:05:09,250
Say...

76
00:05:10,833 --> 00:05:13,000
...you remember how good
food used to taste?

77
00:05:14,500 --> 00:05:17,416
Yeah. BlamCo Mac & Cheese.

78
00:05:17,500 --> 00:05:20,416
Ice cream and apple pie.

79
00:05:20,500 --> 00:05:22,791
Hot damn.

80
00:05:22,875 --> 00:05:24,583
Apple pie.

81
00:05:24,666 --> 00:05:26,458
You know, my mom used to...

82
00:05:41,958 --> 00:05:43,750
Wait...

83
00:05:43,833 --> 00:05:45,083
Why'd you do that?

84
00:05:46,125 --> 00:05:47,625
He was sick.

85
00:05:56,041 --> 00:05:58,166
Stop. Stop, stop. Please, I...

86
00:05:58,250 --> 00:06:00,770
No, I know it's hard up here,
but you don't... you don't have...

87
00:06:00,833 --> 00:06:04,458
you don't have to resort to... to...

88
00:06:04,541 --> 00:06:07,083
What'd you say your name was?

89
00:06:07,166 --> 00:06:09,166
Lucy MacLean.

90
00:06:11,250 --> 00:06:12,875
MacLean?

91
00:06:14,916 --> 00:06:16,708
Huh.

92
00:06:17,875 --> 00:06:20,750
Well, Lucy MacLean,

93
00:06:20,833 --> 00:06:25,208
it ain't all canned peaches and marmalade
left up here, sweetheart.

94
00:06:25,291 --> 00:06:29,041
Sometimes a fella's got to eat a fella.

95
00:06:31,041 --> 00:06:33,083
Mmm. Mmm.

96
00:06:34,125 --> 00:06:35,541
Mmm.

97
00:06:37,750 --> 00:06:39,916
You know, my vault
has endured hardship, too.

98
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:42,291
In the Great Plague of '77,

99
00:06:42,375 --> 00:06:45,041
everyone had to quarantine,
they couldn't work the farms together.

100
00:06:45,125 --> 00:06:47,291
People starved.

101
00:06:47,375 --> 00:06:49,125
My mother included.

102
00:06:49,208 --> 00:06:51,166
My dad dropped to 128 pounds,

103
00:06:51,250 --> 00:06:53,500
and he still refused
to do anything like this.

104
00:06:55,625 --> 00:06:57,291
What? What's so funny?

105
00:06:57,375 --> 00:07:01,833
Well, there's what people say they did

106
00:07:01,916 --> 00:07:04,250
and what they really did.

107
00:07:04,333 --> 00:07:08,583
I'll bet your daddy
was first in line at the cookout.

108
00:07:08,666 --> 00:07:15,375
I bet he had a bib with a drawing
of his neighbor's ass on there.

109
00:07:17,041 --> 00:07:19,375
How do you live like this?

110
00:07:20,458 --> 00:07:22,500
Why keep going?

111
00:07:33,083 --> 00:07:37,041
Well, one good question deserves another.

112
00:07:39,458 --> 00:07:43,625
Why the fuck am I doing all the work?

113
00:07:45,208 --> 00:07:47,125
Now come on, Vaultie.

114
00:07:47,208 --> 00:07:50,166

123
00:08:41,916 --> 00:08:45,125
I've been admiring yours as well.

124
00:08:45,208 --> 00:08:46,583
Any luck?

125
00:08:46,666 --> 00:08:48,125
I asked him all sorts of questions.

126
00:08:48,208 --> 00:08:50,791
Who he is, who he works for,

127
00:08:50,875 --> 00:08:54,000
why his colleagues kidnapped
Overseer MacLean.

128
00:08:54,083 --> 00:08:58,000
What organizing principle, if any,
they operate under.

129
00:08:58,083 --> 00:08:59,458
Nothing, huh?

130
00:09:02,583 --> 00:09:05,500
Two hundred years with no contact.

131
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:09,416
The terrible things this creature
must have been through.

132
00:09:10,458 --> 00:09:12,291
What's he doing?

133
00:09:12,375 --> 00:09:14,416
Oh, no.

134
00:09:14,500 --> 00:09:16,958
Sir? Please stop.
You will injure yourself.

135
00:09:17,041 --> 00:09:18,250
Fuck you!

136
00:09:19,416 --> 00:09:21,500
We better tranq him again.

137
00:09:21,583 --> 00:09:25,041
- For his own safety.
- We'll try again tomorrow.

138
00:09:41,291 --> 00:09:42,416
There you are.

139
00:09:42,500 --> 00:09:45,083
Thought you might be up here.

140
00:09:45,166 --> 00:09:48,250
Made pie if you'd like a piece.

141
00:09:49,750 --> 00:09:54,916
I was there the first time that you tried
rhubarb pie and ice cream.

142
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:57,416
You sure did like pie that day.

143
00:10:01,458 --> 00:10:04,750
You came here to talk to me
about what I said at the assembly.

144
00:10:04,833 --> 00:10:07,541
And why do you think that is?

145
00:10:07,625 --> 00:10:09,333
It upset people.

146
00:10:09,416 --> 00:10:11,791
You don't like it when people get upset.

147
00:10:11,875 --> 00:10:13,958
But you do?

148
00:10:16,083 --> 00:10:20,458
You're not the only one that feels
the absence of your father.

149
00:10:20,541 --> 00:10:22,625
People here are hurting.

150
00:10:22,708 --> 00:10:25,166
Disoriented.

151
00:10:25,250 --> 00:10:29,333
And with your sister gone,
you're the last standing MacLean.

152
00:10:29,416 --> 00:10:33,666
Your voice carries more weight
than you might realize.

153
00:10:35,500 --> 00:10:37,000
I hid.

154
00:10:38,791 --> 00:10:41,458
During the raid,
I got in a storage space and I hid.

155
00:10:43,375 --> 00:10:45,500
Does that make you angry?

156
00:10:47,875 --> 00:10:49,541
Why does it matter?

157
00:10:54,125 --> 00:10:56,250
Regular boys...

158
00:10:57,416 --> 00:11:02,041
...can get angry
and they'll just pee on the wall.

159
00:11:02,125 --> 00:11:04,583
When clever boys like you are angry...

160
00:11:04,666 --> 00:11:06,083
Hmm.

161
00:11:06,166 --> 00:11:09,291
You're lucky not to have seen
where that can lead.

162
00:11:16,291 --> 00:11:18,708
Just tread lightly.

163
00:11:21,208 --> 00:11:23,500
That's all I ask.

164
00:12:06,500 --> 00:12:07,916
Mmm.

165
00:12:28,791 --> 00:12:30,875
Now you're getting it.

166
00:12:38,208 --> 00:12:42,708
How does that Golden Rule jibe with what's
going through your head right now?

167
00:12:51,916 --> 00:12:54,833
What are you?

168
00:12:55,875 --> 00:13:01,041
Oh, I'm you, sweetie.
You just give it a little time.

169
00:13:42,583 --> 00:13:46,125
Where you think you going?
You ain't going nowhere.

170
00:13:54,041 --> 00:13:57,916
There you are, you little killer.

171
00:13:59,666 --> 00:14:01,250
Aah!

172
00:14:14,750 --> 00:14:20,875
Now, that right there is the closest thing
we've had to an honest exchange so far.

I thought I'd just stop by
and see how you're doing.

00:15:04,666 --> 00:15:08,083
- Not great, to be honest.
- Mm.

181
00:15:09,333 --> 00:15:13,875
First I lost Lucy, and then
I lost my job as the Gate-Keeper.

182
00:15:13,958 --> 00:15:17,541
- Right.
- How are you handling the, uh...

183
00:15:19,541 --> 00:15:22,583
...death of the father
of your unborn baby?

184
00:15:23,750 --> 00:15:24,875
Same.

185
00:15:24,958 --> 00:15:29,083
I was actually just organizing
some of Bert's things, and,

186
00:15:29,166 --> 00:15:32,916
well, I thought maybe
you might want some of them?

187
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:34,000
Oh.

188
00:15:40,833 --> 00:15:42,458
This is all that's left of him.

189
00:15:42,541 --> 00:15:44,666
He was a good man, Steph.

190
00:15:45,666 --> 00:15:46,583
You think so?

191
00:15:46,666 --> 00:15:49,666
Of course. I mean, what can you say?

192
00:15:53,750 --> 00:15:54,958
Well...

193
00:15:56,958 --> 00:15:58,708
He took great care of his shoes.

194
00:15:59,833 --> 00:16:02,958
You know, it was one
of the few things he truly loved.

195
00:16:03,041 --> 00:16:05,833
Get him talking about shoe maintenance,

196
00:16:05,916 --> 00:16:07,041
and...

197
00:16:07,125 --> 00:16:10,416
he'd just carry on
until everyone left the room.

198
00:16:11,708 --> 00:16:13,625
I loved him so much.

199
00:16:14,791 --> 00:16:18,416
And those monsters took him away from me.

200
00:16:18,500 --> 00:16:20,416
Awful.

201
00:16:20,500 --> 00:16:22,041
Hate those guys.

202
00:16:22,125 --> 00:16:26,458
It would mean a lot to me
if you took Bert's shoes.

203
00:16:27,500 --> 00:16:29,583
Wow.

204
00:16:29,666 --> 00:16:33,291
Thank you, Steph. I'll...

205
00:16:33,375 --> 00:16:35,791
- I'll try to wear them.
- Oh, good.

206
00:16:35,875 --> 00:16:37,500
And this...

207
00:16:45,333 --> 00:16:47,375
Oh, Bert.

208
00:16:48,458 --> 00:16:51,833
Bert... Bert.

209
00:16:51,916 --> 00:16:54,166
- Okay...
- Oh, Bert.

210
00:16:54,250 --> 00:16:57,125
Oh, Bert.

211
00:16:57,208 --> 00:17:00,083
Oh, Bert.

212
00:17:00,166 --> 00:17:02,583
Oh, Bert.

213
00:17:02,666 --> 00:17:04,125
Bert.

214
00:17:05,250 --> 00:17:06,500
Bert.

215
00:17:16,500 --> 00:17:17,833
Oh, no, no, no.

216
00:17:17,916 --> 00:17:19,750
Could you just keep it on while we...?

217
00:17:19,833 --> 00:17:21,458
Oh, yeah, of course, I'm sorry.

218
00:17:21,541 --> 00:17:22,958
What was I thinking?

219
00:17:23,041 --> 00:17:25,375
<i>♪ Makes your daddy want to rock ♪</i>

220
00:17:26,375 --> 00:17:29,000
Oh, Bert.

221
00:17:29,083 --> 00:17:32,250
- Yes, I am Bert.
- Yeah.

222
00:17:37,375 --> 00:17:40,416
Now, that is one wet lady.

223
00:17:40,500 --> 00:17:41,666
Oh. Oh, oh, oh.

224
00:17:46,333 --> 00:17:47,875
- Bert!
- Oh! <i>- ♪ It's the movement ♪</i>

225
00:17:47,958 --> 00:17:52,458
<i>♪ That gives it the sock. ♪</i>

226
00:18:30,666 --> 00:18:32,666
Transaction.

227
00:18:32,750 --> 00:18:33,875
<i>Yes?</i>

228
00:18:35,625 --> 00:18:37,875
Two-month supply of vials.

229
00:18:37,958 --> 00:18:40,041
Exchange one female.
Mint condition.

230
00:18:43,625 --> 00:18:45,208
Near mint condition.

231
00:18:45,291 --> 00:18:48,791
<i>Condition grading requires
physical evaluation.</i>

232
00:18:48,875 --> 00:18:50,291
<i>Please send her in.</i>

233
00:18:56,666 --> 00:18:57,916
What's in there?

234
00:19:01,041 --> 00:19:02,500
You're about to find out.

235
00:19:04,208 --> 00:19:06,041
You're selling me?

236
00:19:08,458 --> 00:19:11,625
You got problems
out here, too, sweetheart.

237
00:19:11,708 --> 00:19:14,458
Best you try your luck behind that door.

238
00:19:22,958 --> 00:19:23,958
Go on.

239
00:20:32,875 --> 00:20:33,791
<i>Welcome.</i>

240
00:20:33,875 --> 00:20:37,083
- What the fudge?
<i>- Fudge? There's no fudge here.</i>

241
00:20:37,166 --> 00:20:40,291
<i>Only a General Atomics International
Mark 4.</i>

242
00:20:40,375 --> 00:20:43,375
<i>That's what I am.
You seem to be a woman.</i>

243
00:20:44,500 --> 00:20:46,250
Please, sir, my name is Lucy MacLean.

244
00:20:46,333 --> 00:20:49,208
My dad's been taken
and I-I-I've been kidnapped.

245
00:20:49,291 --> 00:20:51,000
He's right outside...

246
00:20:51,083 --> 00:20:52,916
<i>I say, you've lost a finger.</i>

247
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:55,541
<i>Ah, that won't do at all.</i>

248
00:20:55,625 --> 00:20:58,583
<i>Let's get you taken care of.
Follow me.</i>

249
00:21:07,916 --> 00:21:09,250
Okay.

250
00:21:11,708 --> 00:21:12,750
<i>Apologies for the mess.</i>

251
00:21:12,833 --> 00:21:15,000
<i>Time flies by lately.</i>

252
00:21:15,083 --> 00:21:18,250
<i>Especially since my temporal sensors
went out in the Great War.</i>

253
00:21:18,333 --> 00:21:20,708
<i>That must have been a week ago, at least.</i>

254
00:21:21,708 --> 00:21:25,125
<i>Would you mind taking a seat
on that gurney in front of you?</i>

255
00:21:26,166 --> 00:21:28,500
<i>Now, what have we here?</i>

256
00:21:29,541 --> 00:21:31,458
<i>Too fat, too withered.</i>

257
00:21:31,541 --> 00:21:33,500
<i>Ah, this one'll do it.</i>

258
00:21:33,583 --> 00:21:35,500
<i>Eh, you're lucky
I don't have to use a thumb.</i>

259
00:21:35,583 --> 00:21:39,500
<i>Our finger inventory's in a sorry state.</i>

260
00:21:39,583 --> 00:21:41,875
<i>Now, if you give me your hand...</i>

261
00:21:43,708 --> 00:21:46,375
<i>Okay, you're going to feel a slight pinch.</i>

262
00:21:49,125 --> 00:21:50,125
Thank you.

263
00:21:50,166 --> 00:21:52,625
<i>- I say.</i>
- I really do appreciate this.

264
00:21:52,708 --> 00:21:55,828
But listen, a big fish ate my head,
and I need my head to get back to my dad...

265
00:21:55,875 --> 00:21:56,875
<i>There now.</i>

266
00:21:56,958 --> 00:21:58,625
<i>That's much better, isn't it?</i>

267
00:22:01,375 --> 00:22:04,500
- Thank you, that...
<i>- Not a problem.</i>

268
00:22:04,583 --> 00:22:07,083
That feels really, really nice.

269
00:22:07,166 --> 00:22:10,625
<i>Now, would you prefer a dressing
of high-quality synthetic fibers,</i>

270
00:22:10,708 --> 00:22:15,208
<i>classic cotton,
or a comforting synthetic-cotton blend?</i>

271
00:22:15,291 --> 00:22:18,000
You have... real cotton?

272
00:22:18,083 --> 00:22:20,375
<i>Of course. Don't you?</i>

273
00:22:23,416 --> 00:22:24,458
Thank you.

274
00:22:24,541 --> 00:22:29,541
You know, that...
that creature that brought me here, he...

275
00:22:29,625 --> 00:22:31,583
<i>You seem unhappy.</i>

276
00:22:31,666 --> 00:22:33,666
- He did not treat me very courteously.
<i>- Really?</i>

277
00:22:33,750 --> 00:22:36,101
When I pointed out that he wasn't
following the Golden Rule,

278
00:22:36,125 --> 00:22:38,392
he put a leash around my neck
and he made me drink from puddle water

279
00:22:38,416 --> 00:22:40,226
that I'm pretty sure was just
some kind of animal pee.

280
00:22:40,250 --> 00:22:41,458
<i>Well, that is interesting.</i>

281
00:22:41,541 --> 00:22:44,333
- And I thought I was here to be a sex slave.
<i>- What?!</i>

282
00:22:44,416 --> 00:22:47,166
<i>No! What a disgusting idea.</i>

283
00:22:48,541 --> 00:22:50,875
<i>I'm simply going to harvest your organs.</i>

284
00:22:50,958 --> 00:22:52,708
Huh?

285
00:23:04,125 --> 00:23:06,291
Dessert tray incoming.

286
00:23:11,333 --> 00:23:12,625
Hey, hey.

287
00:23:12,708 --> 00:23:15,000
You gonna take that from her?

288
00:23:15,083 --> 00:23:16,291
You gonna take that?

289
00:23:17,458 --> 00:23:18,625
Hey, Norm.

290
00:23:18,708 --> 00:23:20,000
Veronica.

291
00:23:23,958 --> 00:23:26,083
Wait, they're getting Jell-O cake?

292
00:23:27,125 --> 00:23:29,291
Those are my orders.

293
00:23:30,875 --> 00:23:32,559
I wonder what your dad
would say about this.

294
00:23:32,583 --> 00:23:34,958
He'd be handing them the cake himself.

295
00:23:35,041 --> 00:23:37,166
Yeah. He was a saint.

296
00:23:41,666 --> 00:23:42,958
Do you want it?

297
00:23:43,041 --> 00:23:44,500
Mm-hmm.

298
00:23:44,583 --> 00:23:45,583
Nobody's gonna know.

299
00:23:45,625 --> 00:23:47,500
Yeah.

300
00:23:47,583 --> 00:23:49,625
I'm gonna put this in my fridge.

301
00:23:57,125 --> 00:23:58,458
What are you looking at?

302
00:24:00,333 --> 00:24:03,541
A murderer in a cage

303
00:24:03,625 --> 00:24:06,041
paying the price for what you did to us.

304
00:24:07,041 --> 00:24:09,708
For what you did
to the innocent people in Vault 32.

305
00:24:12,208 --> 00:24:14,791
I don't know what the people
in Vault 32 were up to.

306
00:24:16,958 --> 00:24:20,583
But it was anything but innocent.

307
00:24:38,083 --> 00:24:40,416
31 and 32.

308
00:25:09,666 --> 00:25:11,708
Norm. Hi.

309
00:25:18,125 --> 00:25:19,525
Feel like getting out of the house?

310
00:25:19,583 --> 00:25:21,333
Yes.

311
00:25:31,875 --> 00:25:33,958
<i>Maybe he was messing with me,</i>

312
00:25:34,041 --> 00:25:36,541
but one of the raiders told me
there was something up in 32.

313
00:25:36,625 --> 00:25:37,833
Uh-huh.

314
00:25:37,916 --> 00:25:41,250
Well, this isn't exactly fun for me, Norm.

315
00:25:41,333 --> 00:25:43,125
Then why'd you come?

316
00:25:43,208 --> 00:25:44,708
To be honest, I don't know.

317
00:25:45,750 --> 00:25:47,684
You don't think it's because
you're still in love with my sister

318
00:25:47,708 --> 00:25:48,767
and being around me reminds you of her?

319
00:25:51,083 --> 00:25:52,208
Hmm.

320
00:25:56,041 --> 00:25:57,833
This is so wrong.

321
00:25:57,916 --> 00:25:59,541
Come on.

322
00:25:59,625 --> 00:26:01,875
You have to see this.

323
00:26:01,958 --> 00:26:04,833
Wrong, wrong, wrong.

324
00:26:48,875 --> 00:26:50,125
You see?

325
00:26:50,208 --> 00:26:52,833
Whatever happened here
happened a long time ago.

326
00:27:45,583 --> 00:27:48,791
The last bio-signal detected
was two years ago.

327
00:28:09,250 --> 00:28:12,458
<i>This rodent colony
is called a mouse utopia.</i>

328
00:28:12,541 --> 00:28:16,166
<i>Inside, the mice enjoy all the amenities...</i>

329
00:28:16,250 --> 00:28:20,291
<i>all the food they can eat,
all the padding they can sleep on...</i>

330
00:28:20,375 --> 00:28:24,625
<i>but eventually overpopulation occurs.</i>

331
00:28:24,708 --> 00:28:28,583
<i>The mice fight for the once bountiful
food, the once endless space.</i>

332
00:28:28,666 --> 00:28:32,583
<i>They eat each other
in their desperation to survive.</i>

333
00:28:57,250 --> 00:29:01,166
So, if they were already dead
when the raiders got here,

334
00:29:01,250 --> 00:29:02,833
who killed them?

335
00:29:02,916 --> 00:29:08,500
I mean, it looks like they strangled
each other with their hands.

336
00:29:08,583 --> 00:29:11,291
It just doesn't make any sense.

337
00:29:41,125 --> 00:29:43,000
<i>Lucy.</i>

338
00:29:48,291 --> 00:29:49,375
<i>Lucy, sweetie,</i>

339
00:29:49,458 --> 00:29:51,083
what are you doing out here?

340
00:30:00,250 --> 00:30:01,541
My name is Martha.

341
00:30:01,625 --> 00:30:04,833
Martha. My name is Martha.

342
00:30:04,916 --> 00:30:10,125
Martha. My name is Martha. Martha.

343
00:30:10,208 --> 00:30:12,125
My name is Martha.

344
00:30:12,208 --> 00:30:14,041
Martha.

345
00:30:17,916 --> 00:30:19,416
<i>Pardon the interruption.</i>

346
00:30:19,500 --> 00:30:23,083
<i>Our latest arrival has arrived.</i>

347
00:30:23,166 --> 00:30:25,250
Oh, shit.

348
00:30:25,333 --> 00:30:27,458
What are they asking, Snip Snip?

349
00:30:27,541 --> 00:30:29,291
<i>Sixty vials.</i>

350
00:30:33,250 --> 00:30:34,541
We can do 60.

351
00:30:34,625 --> 00:30:36,583
<i>- Fantastic.</i>
- Oh, do her now

352
00:30:36,666 --> 00:30:39,208
so she's ready for the next pickup.

353
00:30:39,291 --> 00:30:41,833
<i>Excellent idea as always, sir.</i>

354
00:30:41,916 --> 00:30:43,041
Thanks, Snip Snip.

355
00:30:43,125 --> 00:30:44,208
<i>Do excuse me.</i>

356
00:30:44,291 --> 00:30:46,291
Nice robot.

357
00:30:47,291 --> 00:30:49,333
<i>Where are you from again?</i>

358
00:30:50,416 --> 00:30:54,666
<i>Never been there myself.
Hope to go there someday soon.</i>

359
00:31:02,250 --> 00:31:04,416
<i>Here we are.
Let's get on with it, shall we?</i>

360
00:31:04,500 --> 00:31:06,875
<i>We don't want to keep
your associate waiting.</i>

361
00:31:10,583 --> 00:31:13,083
Sir, you can't do this.

362
00:31:13,166 --> 00:31:15,166
Please, I need my organs.

363
00:31:15,250 --> 00:31:16,458
<i>Now, don't be afraid.</i>

364
00:31:16,541 --> 00:31:19,166
<i>A little snip-snip
and it will all be over.</i>

365
00:31:21,583 --> 00:31:23,583
<i>Hold still now.</i>

366
00:31:25,416 --> 00:31:27,708
<i>This won't hurt a bit.</i>

367
00:31:35,083 --> 00:31:36,958
<i>Excuse me.</i>

368
00:31:55,041 --> 00:31:57,041
<i>There's no fudge here.</i>

369
00:32:09,416 --> 00:32:12,375
<i>I am ever-ready to serve...</i>

370
00:32:12,458 --> 00:32:14,625
<i>to serve... to serve.</i>

371
00:32:22,291 --> 00:32:23,291
Hands up.

372
00:32:23,375 --> 00:32:26,875
Do as I say,
and Snip Snip doesn't get hurt.

373
00:32:26,958 --> 00:32:28,666
<i> Calling all cars.</i>

374
00:32:28,750 --> 00:32:30,958
It's a fucking robot.

375
00:32:31,041 --> 00:32:33,875
Yeah, you might as well be holding
an air conditioner hostage.

376
00:32:33,958 --> 00:32:36,541
Well, an air conditioner
sounds nice, though.

377
00:32:36,625 --> 00:32:38,601
Yeah, an air conditioner
would be a big deal.

378
00:32:38,625 --> 00:32:39,791
But you know what I mean.

379
00:32:39,875 --> 00:32:42,375
Totally. The question was,

380
00:32:42,458 --> 00:32:43,578
does she know what you mean?

381
00:32:43,625 --> 00:32:47,125
Yeah. I think I do.

382
00:32:47,208 --> 00:32:50,375
That's why I put
Abraxo Draining Fluid in his syringes.

383
00:32:50,458 --> 00:32:54,291
Snip Snip, tell them what Abraxo does
to the human body.

384
00:32:54,375 --> 00:32:56,184
<i>If you've got a c-c-clog
that's full of muck,</i>

385
00:32:56,208 --> 00:33:00,458
<i>trust Abraxo Draining Fluid
t-t-to get it unstuck.</i>

386
00:33:00,541 --> 00:33:02,708
<i>It's v-v-very poisonous.</i>

387
00:33:03,916 --> 00:33:06,541
Okay, you can walk out of here.

388
00:33:06,625 --> 00:33:08,583
Not just me.

389
00:33:08,666 --> 00:33:10,666
Them, too.

390
00:33:29,125 --> 00:33:30,875
Hey, thank you.

391
00:33:38,791 --> 00:33:40,708
I said all of them.

392
00:33:40,791 --> 00:33:43,666
Lady, those-those ones,
you don't understand...

393
00:33:47,208 --> 00:33:49,166
Whoa.

394
00:34:01,166 --> 00:34:03,541
Don't be scared.

395
00:34:03,625 --> 00:34:06,125
You're free. Go.

396
00:34:17,833 --> 00:34:19,625
Oh, gosh.

397
00:34:29,916 --> 00:34:31,541
<i>Hello there.</i>

398
00:34:34,291 --> 00:34:35,791
<i>Goodbye.</i>

399
00:34:51,291 --> 00:34:54,416
Martha. My name is Martha.

400
00:35:04,541 --> 00:35:06,833
Martha. My name is Martha.

401
00:35:06,916 --> 00:35:10,333
That's right. Your name is Martha.

402
00:35:14,375 --> 00:35:17,083
No. No.

403
00:35:22,250 --> 00:35:25,708
Martha. My name is Martha.

404
00:35:25,791 --> 00:35:27,666
Please, please.

405
00:35:29,750 --> 00:35:31,830
Come on, I know there's someone
in there. Talk to me.

406
00:35:34,416 --> 00:35:35,875
Please!

407
00:35:58,583 --> 00:36:00,916
<i>Pardon me, madam.</i>

408
00:36:01,000 --> 00:36:03,416
<i>Could I help you have a better day?</i>

409
00:36:03,500 --> 00:36:05,458
No, thank you.

410
00:36:33,208 --> 00:36:34,916
Oh, geez.

411
00:36:53,875 --> 00:36:56,375
Okay.

412
00:36:56,458 --> 00:37:00,083
I think it's safe to say
they went bananas.

413
00:37:00,166 --> 00:37:03,000
This still doesn't explain
how the raiders got in.

414
00:37:15,208 --> 00:37:17,833
These people were crazy.

415
00:37:17,916 --> 00:37:19,434
If there were any survivors down here,

416
00:37:19,458 --> 00:37:22,291
they probably opened the door
and welcomed the raiders right in.

417
00:37:34,958 --> 00:37:37,833
It says it was opened from the outside.

418
00:37:37,916 --> 00:37:39,833
No.

419
00:37:39,916 --> 00:37:41,500
They'd need a Pip-Boy to open the door.

420
00:37:41,583 --> 00:37:43,166
They had one.

421
00:37:43,250 --> 00:37:44,250
Whose?

422
00:37:48,833 --> 00:37:50,750
My mom's.

423
00:38:19,541 --> 00:38:24,291
You don't get these,
you turn into one of those?

424
00:38:24,375 --> 00:38:25,875
That how it works?

425
00:38:48,333 --> 00:38:50,791
I may end up looking like you...

426
00:38:52,916 --> 00:38:55,416
...but I'll never be like you.

427
00:39:05,916 --> 00:39:07,958
