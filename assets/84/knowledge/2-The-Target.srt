Before the war,

people joked about cockroaches
surviving a nuclear blast.

But they didn't merely survive.

121
00:10:07,916 --> 00:10:10,041

125
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:28,000
Such as yourself.

126
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:35,291

00:10:39,583 --> 00:10:41,625
Sir, I'm looking for my father.

128
00:10:42,666 --> 00:10:45,583

00:10:45,666 --> 00:10:47,250

- Listen,

130
00:10:47,333 --> 00:10:49,583

131
00:10:49,666 --> 00:10:52,708
Vault dwellers

132
00:10:52,791 --> 00:10:55,500
You come from a world of rules, of laws.

133
00:10:55,583 --> 00:10:58,708
This place is indifferent to all of that.

134
00:11:00,208 --> 00:11:02,916
I do not think you would be willing to do

135
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:06,458
what it takes to survive up here.

136
00:11:09,750 --> 00:11:11,750

137
00:11:17,375 --> 00:11:19,875
If you insist on staying,

138
00:11:19,958 --> 00:11:22,375
then you will have to adapt.

139
00:11:24,166 --> 00:11:28,041
Question is will you still
want the same things...

140
00:11:29,583 --> 00:11:31,500
...when you have become

141
00:11:31,583 --> 00:11:33,750
a different animal altogether?

142
00:11:42,166 --> 00:11:43,458
Four, come.

143
00:11:43,541 --> 00:11:45,958

144
00:12:43,458 --> 00:12:44,791
My lord Titus.

145
00:12:49,750 --> 00:12:52,583

146
00:12:52,666 --> 00:12:54,500
On the T-60.

147
00:12:54,583 --> 00:12:56,750
Does that-that help with mobility?

148
00:13:04,708 --> 00:13:06,333
Clean that.

149
00:13:40,291 --> 00:13:41,791
Set us down.

150
00:13:42,916 --> 00:13:45,791
I'm bored and I want to shoot something.

151
00:13:45,875 --> 00:13:48,291
No, my lord, we were assigned
to search a town called Filly.

152
00:13:48,375 --> 00:13:50,666
We're still miles from...

153
00:14:08,958 --> 00:14:11,041
Oh, God. Oh...

154
00:14:16,416 --> 00:14:18,125

00:14:18,208 --> 00:14:19,791

00:16:39,458 --> 00:16:41,250
Look, my lord.

157
00:16:46,708 --> 00:16:49,041
They were here. A man.

158
00:16:49,125 --> 00:16:50,583
And a dog.

159
00:16:50,666 --> 00:16:52,416
The target.

160
00:16:52,500 --> 00:16:53,541
Yes, they were...

161
00:16:56,875 --> 00:16:57,875
Fuck.

162
00:17:45,166 --> 00:17:46,875
Go see if the target's in there.

163
00:17:48,125 --> 00:17:51,250
But-but, my l-my lord,
I-I don't have armor.

164
00:17:51,333 --> 00:17:54,041
You earn the suit through acts of bravery.

165
00:17:54,125 --> 00:17:57,333
This is an act of bravery.

166
00:17:57,416 --> 00:17:59,125
But-but my lord, I...

167
00:17:59,208 --> 00:18:01,041
An order, my squire.

168
00:18:02,541 --> 00:18:04,166

169
00:18:20,416 --> 00:18:21,916
See anything?

170
00:18:25,750 --> 00:18:28,041
What's the problem, dipshit?

171
00:18:39,416 --> 00:18:40,708

00:19:41,250 --> 00:19:42,750
Help me!

183
00:19:42,833 --> 00:19:45,208
Oh! Shoot it!

184
00:19:45,291 --> 00:19:47,083
Shoot it!

185
00:19:50,166 --> 00:19:51,208
Shoot it!

186
00:20:04,375 --> 00:20:07,000
Fuck. Fuck.

187
00:20:07,083 --> 00:20:08,791
Help.

188
00:20:08,875 --> 00:20:11,208
Get this fucking thing off me.

189
00:20:12,333 --> 00:20:13,458
Help.

190
00:20:13,541 --> 00:20:15,541
Help me.

191
00:20:15,625 --> 00:20:17,916
Oh, fuck.

192
00:20:19,958 --> 00:20:21,916
Oh, fuck.

193
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:25,541
Fuck. Fuck this sh...

194
00:20:25,625 --> 00:20:27,166
Fuck!

195
00:20:27,250 --> 00:20:29,041
Where were you?

196
00:20:29,125 --> 00:20:30,958
Huh?

197
00:20:31,041 --> 00:20:32,958
This fucking place.

198
00:20:33,041 --> 00:20:35,291
There's always something

199
00:20:35,375 --> 00:20:37,041
to ruin your fuckin' day.

200
00:20:38,125 --> 00:20:40,208
This wasteland fucking sucks.

201
00:20:41,750 --> 00:20:45,333
The clerics, too. With their bullshit.

202
00:20:45,416 --> 00:20:48,708
Sending me on stupid missions

203
00:20:48,791 --> 00:20:51,000
for remnants that turn out to be...

204
00:20:52,250 --> 00:20:54,250
...a fucking toaster oven.

205
00:20:56,708 --> 00:20:59,583
You know what you could do
with a fucking toaster oven?

206
00:20:59,666 --> 00:21:02,625
Do you have any idea?

207
00:21:04,583 --> 00:21:05,875
Get me a stimpak.

208
00:21:05,958 --> 00:21:08,500
What the fuck are you doing, man?

209
00:21:08,583 --> 00:21:10,125
Can you get me a fucking stimpak

210
00:21:10,208 --> 00:21:11,875
instead of just standing there?

211
00:21:12,916 --> 00:21:15,416
I'm asking you for a stimpak

212
00:21:15,500 --> 00:21:16,916
and you're looking at me...

213
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:19,750
you're looking at me like
you don't know what the fuck to do.

214
00:21:19,833 --> 00:21:22,125
I got a two-ton

215
00:21:22,208 --> 00:21:24,291
irradiated bear on my back,

216
00:21:24,375 --> 00:21:26,041
and you're standing there...

217
00:21:27,125 --> 00:21:28,666
You stupid motherfucker,

218
00:21:28,750 --> 00:21:30,666
you know this is all your fault.

219
00:21:36,250 --> 00:21:38,625
You know what they do to squires

220
00:21:38,708 --> 00:21:41,166
that don't do their fucking job?

221
00:21:41,250 --> 00:21:42,625
They string you up...

222
00:21:45,708 --> 00:21:48,125
...Maximus, by your, uh, lungs,

223
00:21:48,208 --> 00:21:50,750
and they, uh, they hang you...

224
00:21:52,875 --> 00:21:55,166
...and let the vultures come get you.

225
00:21:56,833 --> 00:21:58,500
That's what they're gonna do to you.

226
00:22:01,916 --> 00:22:06,291
You got to be
the worst fuckin' squire there is.

227
00:22:07,291 --> 00:22:09,041
This is all your fault.

228
00:22:09,125 --> 00:22:11,541
You dumb motherfucker, you.

229
00:22:14,583 --> 00:22:16,625
Get me a stimpak.

230
00:22:16,708 --> 00:22:18,375
Get me a stimpak!

231
00:22:18,458 --> 00:22:20,791
I can't breathe.

232
00:22:32,791 --> 00:22:34,791
It is a knight's duty

233
00:22:34,875 --> 00:22:37,333
to better this fallen world.

234
00:22:39,333 --> 00:22:41,958
You don't deserve that armor.

235
00:22:44,708 --> 00:22:46,500
Oh, you think you do?

236
00:22:55,875 --> 00:22:57,375
You fuck.

237
00:22:59,750 --> 00:23:03,125
They'll kill you for this. You...

238
00:23:03,208 --> 00:23:05,750
Not if I bring back the target.

239
00:23:05,833 --> 00:23:07,625
You...

240
00:23:26,625 --> 00:23:28,958
Work, damn you!

241
00:23:31,791 --> 00:23:33,666
Hi, hello! Excuse me.

242
00:23:35,166 --> 00:23:36,166
Excuse me!

243
00:23:36,250 --> 00:23:38,041
Hi!

244
00:23:38,125 --> 00:23:39,625
May I approach?

245
00:23:39,708 --> 00:23:41,458
I ain't got weapons.

246
00:23:41,541 --> 00:23:43,500
- Oh...
- Or money.

247
00:23:43,583 --> 00:23:47,125
It's okay, I just want
to ask you for directions.

248
00:23:48,500 --> 00:23:50,708
Okay.

249
00:24:04,916 --> 00:24:06,125
Sorry.

250
00:24:09,208 --> 00:24:11,208
I'm-I'm a little lost.

251
00:24:12,583 --> 00:24:14,208
Hi.

252
00:24:14,291 --> 00:24:17,125
What's that you're working on?

253
00:24:17,208 --> 00:24:19,625
It's meant to be a water filter.

254
00:24:19,708 --> 00:24:23,208
No matter how much sand I put in it,
I just get more sand.

255
00:24:23,291 --> 00:24:26,375
Well, h... have you tried water

256
00:24:26,458 --> 00:24:27,833
for the water filter?

257
00:24:34,333 --> 00:24:35,750
You got water?

258
00:24:35,833 --> 00:24:38,958
Oh, uh, would you like a sip?

259
00:24:39,041 --> 00:24:40,375
Here.

260
00:24:47,458 --> 00:24:50,916
Uh... sorry. Uh, s-sir,

261
00:24:51,000 --> 00:24:52,875
I actually... I might...

262
00:24:52,958 --> 00:24:54,625
I need that.

263
00:24:54,708 --> 00:24:56,750
Yeah, me too.

264
00:24:56,833 --> 00:24:58,333
Thank you.

265
00:24:58,416 --> 00:25:02,041
Somebody hands you
a bottle of clean water, you drink it.

266
00:25:02,125 --> 00:25:04,500
Even if you're not thirsty, you drink it.

267
00:25:04,583 --> 00:25:06,583
Much as you can, anyway.

268
00:25:06,666 --> 00:25:08,666
Right.

269
00:25:08,750 --> 00:25:10,666
Uh, you haven't happened to have seen

270
00:25:10,750 --> 00:25:12,916
a group pass by with a prisoner, did you?

271
00:25:13,000 --> 00:25:14,291
No.

272
00:25:16,458 --> 00:25:18,791
You headed to Filly?

273
00:25:18,875 --> 00:25:20,500
W-What's Filly?

274
00:25:20,583 --> 00:25:21,750
A town.

275
00:25:23,625 --> 00:25:25,541
It's over that hill.

276
00:25:25,625 --> 00:25:27,708
Never been, myself.

277
00:25:27,791 --> 00:25:30,333
You've never been over that hill?

278
00:25:30,416 --> 00:25:32,791
Nah. It's too dangerous.

279
00:25:32,875 --> 00:25:36,791
People get killed in Filly all the time.

280
00:25:36,875 --> 00:25:39,041
That's where my daddy got killed, anyway.

281
00:25:40,625 --> 00:25:42,708
Couple brothers, too.

282
00:25:42,791 --> 00:25:44,166
Had a aunt as well.

283
00:25:44,250 --> 00:25:45,916
She got killed there once.

284
00:25:47,958 --> 00:25:49,583
I'm sorry to hear that.

285
00:25:49,666 --> 00:25:50,666
Oh, thank you.

286
00:25:51,833 --> 00:25:53,166
Sounds dangerous.

287
00:25:53,250 --> 00:25:56,208
Or you just stay here.

288
00:25:56,291 --> 00:25:58,458
Live with me.

289
00:25:58,541 --> 00:26:01,500
Could use a family.
It helps with all the work.

290
00:26:01,583 --> 00:26:03,250
Uh...

291
00:26:03,333 --> 00:26:05,666
I-I'm okay, but, uh,

292
00:26:05,750 --> 00:26:07,625
thank you so much for the advice.

293
00:26:09,583 --> 00:26:13,208
- I'm real sick. Think I'm dying.
- Oh...

294
00:26:13,291 --> 00:26:15,500
You wouldn't have to
put up with me for too long.

295
00:26:16,958 --> 00:26:19,250
This could all be yours!

296
00:26:19,333 --> 00:26:21,000
I'm okay.

297
00:26:21,083 --> 00:26:23,208
Uh, thank you.

298
00:26:23,291 --> 00:26:26,916
You're a good person
for not shooting me with that gun.

299
00:26:27,000 --> 00:26:29,041
Oh, it was really no problem.

300
00:26:29,125 --> 00:26:30,916

00:31:40,583 --> 00:31:43,375
Fresh iguana.

366
00:31:43,458 --> 00:31:44,916
Can I interest you in some iguana?

367
00:31:45,000 --> 00:31:48,625
Oh, uh... I'm okay, thank you.

368
00:31:48,708 --> 00:31:50,875
Um, have you seen this man?

369
00:31:52,125 --> 00:31:53,916
Dog meat!

370
00:31:54,000 --> 00:31:57,583
Oh, uh, I'm okay, thank you.

371
00:33:05,291 --> 00:33:06,541
Goddamn maggot!

372
00:33:09,541 --> 00:33:11,375
Oh, sorry.

373
00:33:54,333 --> 00:33:57,125
Uh... hi there.

374
00:34:00,916 --> 00:34:04,625
I noticed that you have
an assortment of Vault-Tec equipment.

375
00:34:04,708 --> 00:34:06,541
Uh-huh.

376
00:34:08,666 --> 00:34:11,791
And, uh, well, because these items

377
00:34:11,875 --> 00:34:14,083
technically belong
to Vault-Tec...

378
00:34:14,166 --> 00:34:18,125
it would be safe to assume
that you do business with criminals.

379
00:34:19,166 --> 00:34:21,500
Not judging you.

380
00:34:21,583 --> 00:34:24,500
Don't imagine there's
that many other options up here.

381
00:34:24,583 --> 00:34:28,375
But I'm actually looking
for one criminal in particular.

382
00:34:28,458 --> 00:34:31,000
Holy shit.

383
00:34:31,083 --> 00:34:33,791
You're an actual vault dweller.

384
00:34:35,041 --> 00:34:36,500
I am.

385
00:34:39,916 --> 00:34:43,208
I thought all you sardine-fucking dipshits
were dead. Barv!

386
00:34:43,291 --> 00:34:45,833
- Get in here. You got to see this.
- Um,

387
00:34:45,916 --> 00:34:49,125
ma'am, the raider I'm looking for
is about five-foot-nine.

388
00:34:49,208 --> 00:34:50,291
Barv.

389
00:34:50,375 --> 00:34:52,500
- A woman in her 50s, I think.
- Barv!

390
00:34:52,583 --> 00:34:55,791
- Goes by the name of Moldaver.
- Barv, get in here. You...

391
00:35:01,083 --> 00:35:03,916
- Get back to your fucking room, Barv.
- Eh.

392
00:35:05,958 --> 00:35:08,833
I take it you know who she is.

393
00:35:08,916 --> 00:35:12,958
Everyone knows who Moldaver is.

394
00:35:13,041 --> 00:35:15,250
Get out of here, vault dweller.

395
00:35:17,333 --> 00:35:20,333
Ma'am, this Moldaver broke into my vault,

396
00:35:20,416 --> 00:35:22,708
took my dad, and-and killed...

397
00:35:22,791 --> 00:35:26,041
And I'm telling you
you're gonna go through a whole lot worse

398
00:35:26,125 --> 00:35:28,916
if you stay around here. Trust me.

399
00:35:29,000 --> 00:35:31,750
I can tell by looking at you.

400
00:35:31,833 --> 00:35:33,791
Clean hair.

401
00:35:33,875 --> 00:35:36,541
Nice teeth. Mm.

402
00:35:36,625 --> 00:35:38,750
And all ten fingers.

403
00:35:40,958 --> 00:35:42,875
Must be nice.

404
00:35:42,958 --> 00:35:45,875
Well, I know that it can't have been easy
for you up here,

405
00:35:45,958 --> 00:35:49,250
what with all the murder and-and the dirt.

406
00:35:50,583 --> 00:35:54,291
But the mission of the vaults
should be important to everyone.

407
00:35:55,958 --> 00:35:57,833
And why is that?

408
00:35:59,333 --> 00:36:01,375
Well, uh...

409
00:36:02,625 --> 00:36:06,291
Well, you see, the idea is, um...

410
00:36:06,375 --> 00:36:07,833
that...

411
00:36:07,916 --> 00:36:10,375
we're going to...

412
00:36:10,458 --> 00:36:11,666
save America.

413
00:36:11,750 --> 00:36:13,333
Ah!

414
00:36:14,791 --> 00:36:18,666
And when exactly
were you planning on saving America?

415
00:36:20,291 --> 00:36:23,125
The vaults were nothing more

416
00:36:23,208 --> 00:36:27,000
than a hole in the ground
for rich folks to hide in

417
00:36:27,083 --> 00:36:29,791
while the rest of the world burned.

418
00:36:35,541 --> 00:36:38,666
We vault dwellers recognize,

419
00:36:38,750 --> 00:36:42,041
uh, and are grateful for
the privileged position we were born into,

420
00:36:42,125 --> 00:36:45,750
- and...
- You know what folks up here

421
00:36:45,833 --> 00:36:47,875
say about the vaults?

422
00:36:48,916 --> 00:36:50,416
What?

423
00:36:50,500 --> 00:36:52,625
Fuck the vaults.

424
00:36:58,750 --> 00:37:00,125
Mm-mm.

425
00:37:05,666 --> 00:37:07,625
Okay, well, uh...

426
00:37:09,500 --> 00:37:11,333
Thank you for your help, ma'am.

427
00:37:43,583 --> 00:37:47,000
Okay, you can go in. Go on.

428
00:37:47,083 --> 00:37:48,791
Go.

429
00:37:55,708 --> 00:37:57,791
You again, miss.

430
00:37:59,333 --> 00:38:04,250
Really think you should go home.
You are not safe here.

431
00:38:06,375 --> 00:38:08,791
That's what people
keep telling me.

432
00:38:08,875 --> 00:38:11,666
No one understands my situation.

433
00:38:12,833 --> 00:38:15,666
You come from Vault 33.

434
00:38:15,750 --> 00:38:18,541
Your primary crop is corn.

435
00:38:18,625 --> 00:38:21,041
You have a Telesonic projector
in your farm.

436
00:38:21,125 --> 00:38:25,000
It loops images
of the Nebraskan countryside.

437
00:38:25,083 --> 00:38:27,458
You've been brought up in a meritocracy,

438
00:38:27,541 --> 00:38:30,791
where people pride themselves
on doing the right thing.

439
00:38:32,083 --> 00:38:34,416
I think I know enough to know

440
00:38:34,500 --> 00:38:36,875
you need to go home.

441
00:38:39,375 --> 00:38:41,291
Who are you?

442
00:38:41,375 --> 00:38:43,708
- And how do you know so much...
- Hey.

443
00:38:45,125 --> 00:38:46,625
You Wilzig?

444
00:38:46,708 --> 00:38:48,416
Let's get you inside.

445
00:38:48,500 --> 00:38:51,625
I told you to get the fuck out of here.

446
00:38:52,708 --> 00:38:53,791
Wilzig.

447
00:39:24,000 --> 00:39:26,583
Now, you wouldn't happen
to be a doctor, would you?

448
00:39:26,666 --> 00:39:29,166
'Cause I happen to be looking for one.

449
00:39:29,250 --> 00:39:32,875
You know your kind ain't welcome here.

450
00:39:32,958 --> 00:39:35,416
Well, maybe not.

451
00:39:35,500 --> 00:39:37,833
But I'm gonna make myself welcome.

452
00:39:39,250 --> 00:39:44,000
Now, last night a bounty came in
through all six agencies.

453
00:39:45,000 --> 00:39:47,208
A hefty price

454
00:39:47,291 --> 00:39:49,375
on the head of a man
that fits the description

455
00:39:49,458 --> 00:39:52,250
of that fella right there.

456
00:40:00,291 --> 00:40:02,375
Now, I may not know much,

457
00:40:02,458 --> 00:40:04,708
but I do know a bidding war
when I see one.

458
00:40:05,750 --> 00:40:07,625
Maybe.

459
00:40:07,708 --> 00:40:10,208
But I've been paid a whole lot of caps

460
00:40:10,291 --> 00:40:13,375
to provide this man
safe transport out of Filly.

461
00:40:14,083 --> 00:40:16,666
Aah!

462
00:40:17,875 --> 00:40:20,208
Change of plans, I guess.

463
00:40:24,541 --> 00:40:26,083
I got a thousand bottle caps

464
00:40:26,166 --> 00:40:28,791
for whoever kills that fucker!

465
00:40:29,958 --> 00:40:33,083
But you don't get shit
if I kill him first.

466
00:41:33,583 --> 00:41:36,208
Damn, y'all done got me
working up a appetite.

467
00:42:09,791 --> 00:42:12,250
Well, I'd offer you one
of these cherry tomatoes,

468
00:42:12,333 --> 00:42:14,666
but you got a hole in your neck.

469
00:42:20,333 --> 00:42:22,083
Mm.

470
00:42:33,000 --> 00:42:34,916
Come on.

471
00:43:07,583 --> 00:43:10,625
Ow! Aah!

472
00:43:15,708 --> 00:43:18,333
For the tomatoes.

473
00:43:22,083 --> 00:43:24,083
Wilzig.

474
00:43:45,416 --> 00:43:48,125
No! No, please.

475
00:44:17,000 --> 00:44:18,666
Wilzig.

476
00:44:26,583 --> 00:44:29,791
I'm going to have to ask you
to leave him alone.

477
00:44:29,875 --> 00:44:32,625
Now, I acknowledge that I'm unfamiliar

478
00:44:32,708 --> 00:44:34,333
with your circumstances.

479
00:44:34,416 --> 00:44:37,833
But, at first glance,
your treatment of this man appears unfair,

480
00:44:37,916 --> 00:44:39,791
and I'm obliged to intervene.

481
00:44:39,875 --> 00:44:41,583
Huh.

482
00:44:41,666 --> 00:44:43,875
Now, if your instinct is to harm me,

483
00:44:43,958 --> 00:44:46,500
as a person simply trying
to deescalate a conflict,

484
00:44:46,583 --> 00:44:48,226
then I'll have to assume,
of the two of you,

485
00:44:48,250 --> 00:44:49,833
you are likely the primary aggressor.

486
00:44:49,916 --> 00:44:51,833
In which case,

487
00:44:51,916 --> 00:44:55,541
I think everyone in this town would agree
that force is justified.

488
00:44:56,625 --> 00:45:00,833
Unless you willingly stand down now.

489
00:45:02,125 --> 00:45:05,000
Fucking vault dwellers. Geez.

490
00:45:06,041 --> 00:45:07,250
Huh.

491
00:45:12,125 --> 00:45:15,583
Well, now,
that is a very small drop

492
00:45:15,666 --> 00:45:19,208
in a very, very large bucket of drugs.

493
00:45:22,625 --> 00:45:24,517
She said
stand down, Ghoul.

494
00:45:45,625 --> 00:45:49,041
Knight Titus of the Brotherhood of Steel.
Stand down

495
00:45:49,125 --> 00:45:52,041
or be cut down.

496
00:45:52,125 --> 00:45:55,541
You got to be fucking kidding me.

497
00:46:06,041 --> 00:46:09,125
Ah...

498
00:46:16,333 --> 00:46:17,875
Hi.

499
00:46:24,083 --> 00:46:28,250
Listen, that man is important.
I've been sent here to find him.

500
00:46:28,333 --> 00:46:30,642
Get him inside and keep him there
until I've dealt with the Ghoul.

501
00:46:30,666 --> 00:46:34,166
Okay. Thank you.

502
00:46:59,000 --> 00:47:02,083
Yeah.

503
00:47:14,416 --> 00:47:16,125
Come on.

504
00:47:25,625 --> 00:47:27,500
Oh...

505
00:47:27,583 --> 00:47:29,916
Eh.

506
00:47:30,000 --> 00:47:33,166
Well, I'd say come up here and get me,
but it's hard

507
00:47:33,250 --> 00:47:36,625
to walk upstairs when you're wearing
a 12-piece cast-iron skillet set.

508
00:47:41,875 --> 00:47:43,375
Gonna need a new foot, Barv!

509
00:47:43,458 --> 00:47:46,750
Trying to eat my beans, but okay.

510
00:47:46,833 --> 00:47:49,041
Aah! Aah!

511
00:47:49,125 --> 00:47:51,833
God, God, God, God, God, God, God...

512
00:47:53,416 --> 00:47:55,333
I can still make this trip.

513
00:47:55,416 --> 00:47:57,559
You'll be lucky if you can make it
to fucking breakfast.

514
00:47:57,583 --> 00:47:59,458
The foot, Barv!

515
00:47:59,541 --> 00:48:01,916
I'm looking for the foot.

516
00:48:02,000 --> 00:48:05,541
We got a whole crate
under the box with the defibrillators.

517
00:48:05,625 --> 00:48:07,958
You keep moving things around
without telling me.

518
00:48:08,041 --> 00:48:10,375
I don't mean to interrupt, but...

519
00:48:10,458 --> 00:48:12,583
was that a knight?

520
00:48:12,666 --> 00:48:14,583
Barv!

521
00:48:16,583 --> 00:48:19,916
Wasn't under the defibrillators.
Just saying.

522
00:48:20,000 --> 00:48:23,333
I'm sorry for yelling.
Been shot in the leg.

523
00:48:23,416 --> 00:48:27,458
Aw, eh, you'd yell at me either way.

524
00:48:32,291 --> 00:48:33,708
Uh...

525
00:48:37,125 --> 00:48:38,500
Holy moly.

526
00:48:45,333 --> 00:48:47,041
She can take me.

527
00:48:51,041 --> 00:48:53,541
If you think this little thing
can haul your

528
00:48:53,625 --> 00:48:55,250
limping ass across the Wasteland,

529
00:48:55,333 --> 00:48:58,208
you may not be as smart
as people say you are.

530
00:48:58,291 --> 00:49:00,750
Do you have anyone else
you can trust in this town?

531
00:49:03,458 --> 00:49:04,958
Shit.

532
00:49:06,583 --> 00:49:08,083
Hey, daddy's girl.

533
00:49:09,625 --> 00:49:13,083
I need you to take this man here
to my client.

534
00:49:14,291 --> 00:49:17,000
Oh, uh, thank you, uh, but

535
00:49:17,083 --> 00:49:19,708
I'm really only here to find my dad. Uh...

536
00:49:19,791 --> 00:49:23,541
Besides, no offense,
but you're in no condition to travel.

537
00:49:23,625 --> 00:49:27,708
My client goes by the name
of Lee Moldaver.

538
00:49:32,250 --> 00:49:35,166
Now, you ain't getting near Moldaver

539
00:49:35,250 --> 00:49:36,791
without something to bargain with,

540
00:49:36,875 --> 00:49:39,750
and delivering this guy right here

541
00:49:39,833 --> 00:49:41,250
is your best option.

542
00:49:43,333 --> 00:49:45,392
Well, what does Moldaver
want with you? I mean,

543
00:49:45,416 --> 00:49:47,166
she steals dads!

544
00:49:49,458 --> 00:49:51,875
Do you want your dad back or not, kid?

545
00:49:51,958 --> 00:49:54,125
- Uh...
- Huh?

546
00:49:54,208 --> 00:49:55,291
I...

547
00:49:56,750 --> 00:49:59,625
Gosh damn it, okay! Uh...

548
00:49:59,708 --> 00:50:02,125
Now, here. This is where

549
00:50:02,208 --> 00:50:04,291
you're gonna find Moldaver.

550
00:50:04,375 --> 00:50:07,708
She and her kind
hole up across the Shithole.

551
00:50:07,791 --> 00:50:09,208
What's the Shithole?

552
00:50:09,291 --> 00:50:12,166
Uh, well, just-just
get to the coordinates.

553
00:50:12,250 --> 00:50:15,750
You know, rads move pretty quick
in and out through there,

554
00:50:15,833 --> 00:50:19,708
so you're gonna need to move fast
if you want to keep your skins.

555
00:50:19,791 --> 00:50:21,541
All right. I can do this.

556
00:50:21,625 --> 00:50:24,250
Yes. You can do this, sure, you can.
You are

557
00:50:24,333 --> 00:50:26,059
- a vault dweller, true to your word.
- Mm-hmm.

558
00:50:26,083 --> 00:50:28,000
This really...

559
00:50:28,083 --> 00:50:30,083
this could...

560
00:50:30,166 --> 00:50:31,583
may-maybe work.

561
00:50:31,666 --> 00:50:33,083
You really mean that?

562
00:50:33,166 --> 00:50:34,666
Go.

563
00:50:35,833 --> 00:50:37,916
Go! Get out the back. Hurry!

564
00:50:40,083 --> 00:50:41,083
Oh!

565
00:50:43,750 --> 00:50:46,375
Goddamn, that hurt.

566
00:51:22,041 --> 00:51:23,666
Oh, shit. Uh...

567
00:51:25,750 --> 00:51:30,083
Well, I guess basic training
ain't what it used to be.

568
00:51:30,166 --> 00:51:32,458
'Cause you drive that thing
like a fucking shopping cart.

569
00:51:38,083 --> 00:51:40,916
Rule number one:

570
00:51:41,000 --> 00:51:42,833
read the manual.

571
00:51:47,666 --> 00:51:49,166
Whoa, whoa...

572
00:52:08,875 --> 00:52:11,083
No, no, no!

573
00:52:20,250 --> 00:52:21,791
Oh, no!

574
00:52:27,375 --> 00:52:28,875
Aah!

575
00:52:30,750 --> 00:52:33,166
Serums to energize.

576
00:52:33,250 --> 00:52:36,083
Serums to invigorate.

577
00:52:37,166 --> 00:52:40,041
Serums to heal your feet.

578
00:52:45,625 --> 00:52:48,250
Serums for pain.

579
00:52:48,333 --> 00:52:51,500
Foot-healing serums!

580
00:52:51,583 --> 00:52:54,250
Serums that will make you grow
an entire new foot.

581
00:52:54,333 --> 00:52:55,833
Maybe.

582
00:53:59,625 --> 00:54:00,916
Huh.

583
00:55:58,708 --> 00:56:00,208
This will have to do.

584
00:56:06,625 --> 00:56:09,458
It says here we have about 20 miles

585
00:56:09,541 --> 00:56:11,500
left to go. How's your new...? Oh.

586
00:56:11,583 --> 00:56:14,541
Oh, golly.

587
00:56:14,625 --> 00:56:17,125
Holy moly.

588
00:56:24,083 --> 00:56:27,166
I'm not going to make it.

589
00:56:30,291 --> 00:56:33,916
Listen, I don't know who you are

590
00:56:34,000 --> 00:56:36,958
or how you know the things that you do,

591
00:56:37,041 --> 00:56:40,416
but you are going to get across
that wasteland.

592
00:56:40,500 --> 00:56:42,500
And we're gonna do it together.

593
00:56:42,583 --> 00:56:44,333
Okay?

594
00:56:44,416 --> 00:56:46,625
That's a promise.

595
00:56:46,708 --> 00:56:49,666
No, you see,
I've just taken a cyanide pill.

596
00:56:52,208 --> 00:56:53,375
What?

597
00:56:53,458 --> 00:56:55,416
Vault-Tec Plan D.

598
00:56:55,500 --> 00:56:58,208
It was the most humane product
that Vault-Tec ever made.

599
00:56:58,291 --> 00:57:00,333
It was quick, painless.

600
00:57:00,416 --> 00:57:02,625
T-Tasted like banana. I...

601
00:57:02,708 --> 00:57:05,500
I was surprised it wasn't more popular.

602
00:57:09,291 --> 00:57:11,291
People are going to come after you.

603
00:57:11,375 --> 00:57:13,375
You'll need to move quickly.

604
00:57:14,750 --> 00:57:18,583
You can change the future

605
00:57:18,666 --> 00:57:21,875
if you can bring me to Moldaver.

606
00:57:23,875 --> 00:57:25,750
But how am I gonna bring you if you're...

607
00:57:25,833 --> 00:57:28,916
No, not-not my whole body.

608
00:57:31,541 --> 00:57:32,750
Just my head.

609
00:57:33,791 --> 00:57:35,250
- Here.
- Pardon?

610
00:57:46,791 --> 00:57:48,458
I took the pill

611
00:57:48,541 --> 00:57:51,958
so that it would be less taxing
for you to go through with it.

612
00:57:52,041 --> 00:57:55,000
It'll be easier if you carry my head

613
00:57:55,083 --> 00:57:57,958
instead of dragging my whole body.

614
00:57:58,041 --> 00:57:59,666
You...

615
00:57:59,750 --> 00:58:03,333
You're asking me to... just...

616
00:58:03,416 --> 00:58:06,791
Please. I'm begging you.

617
00:58:06,875 --> 00:58:09,791
And this is the only way
to get your dad back.

618
00:58:09,875 --> 00:58:12,833
I knew I could trust you.

619
00:58:12,916 --> 00:58:15,875
You are a vault dweller.

620
00:58:15,958 --> 00:58:18,250
But if you're going to survive up here...

621
00:58:19,291 --> 00:58:21,958
...you need to start acting
like a surface dweller.

622
00:58:23,000 --> 00:58:26,416
Okay... Ms. MacLean?

623
00:58:27,416 --> 00:58:29,083
How do you know my name?

624
00:58:31,958 --> 00:58:33,708
Sir?

625
00:58:38,250 --> 00:58:39,750
Sir...

626
00:59:38,750 --> 00:59:40,291
