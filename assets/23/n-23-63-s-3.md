Notice 2023-63

...
## SECTION 3. CAPITALIZATION AND AMORTIZATION OF SRE EXPENDITURES

...

### .7 Example.

#### (1) Facts.

Taxpayer is a calendar-year taxpayer that incorporated and began operations on October 17, 2022. In 2022, Taxpayer paid or incurred $60,000 in SRE expenditures that were not attributable to foreign research. Taxpayer has no short taxable years after its initial taxable year.

#### (2) Analysis.

Taxpayer has a short taxable year that begins on October 17, 2022, and ends on December 31, 2022, and thus is treated as having a three-month taxable year under section 3.06(1) of this notice. The midpoint month is November, and thus November 1, 2022, will be treated as the midpoint under section 3.06(2) of this notice. In 2022, Taxpayer amortizes $2,000 of SRE expenditures ($60,000 / 60 months × 2 months). In taxable years 2023 through 2026, each a full 12-month taxable year, Taxpayer amortizes $12,000 ($60,000 / 60 months × 12 months) each year, or $48,000 total. In 2027, Taxpayer amortizes the remaining $10,000 ($60,000 / 60 months × 10 months).
