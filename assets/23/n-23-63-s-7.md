### .5 Examples.

The following examples illustrate the rules set forth in section 7 of this notice.

#### (1) Sale of property with respect to which SRE expenditures were incurred.

##### (a) Facts.

Company X, an accrual method, calendar-year taxpayer, incurs $100,000 in SRE expenditures in 2023 for research performed in the United States. On September 30, 2025, Company X sells the property with respect to which such expenditures were incurred to Company Y and recognizes gain under § 1001.

##### (b) Analysis.

In 2023, Company X amortizes $10,000 (10% × $100,000). See section 3.05 of this notice. In 2024, Company X amortizes $20,000 (20% × $100,000). In 2025 through 2028, Company X ratably amortizes the remaining $70,000 ($100,000 – $10,000 – $20,000) notwithstanding Company X’s disposition of the assets with respect to which Company X’s SRE expenditures were incurred. Company Y does not amortize any portion of the SRE expenditures originally paid or incurred by Company X. Company X does not factor its unamortized SRE expenditures into the computation of gain or loss under § 1001. See section 7.02 of this notice.
