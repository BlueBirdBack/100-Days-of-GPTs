#### (4) Example.

The following example illustrates the rules set forth in section 4.03 of this notice.

##### (a) Facts.

Company A, a calendar year taxpayer, is engaged in the business of manufacturing chemical products. On January 1, 2023, Company A begins a research project to develop a new product. This research project constitutes an SRE activity.

Company A does not undertake any other SRE activities during its 2023 taxable year. Company A is comprised of six departments: (1) the Manufacturing Department, (2) the Research Department, (3) the Engineering Department, (4) the Legal Department, (5) the Personnel Department, and (6) the Accounting Department. The Manufacturing Department does not provide any support services to the Research Department. The Personnel Department provides indirect support services to the Research Department by hiring research personnel and preparing their paychecks but does not directly support any aspect of the research project. The Accounting Department provides indirect support services to the Research Department by paying Research Department invoices and accounting for research costs but does not directly support any aspect of the research project. The Engineering Department provides direct support services to the Research Department with respect to the research project by collaborating with the Research Department to develop the new product. The Legal Department provides direct support services to the Research Department with respect to the research project by preparing patent applications for the new product. Company A owns the following assets, each of which is used, in whole or in part, to perform research or directly support the research project:

         | Computers, furniture, and equipment used exclusively for the research project | Research Department                                          | $150,000              |
         | Computers, furniture, andequipment used by the Engineering Department | Engineering Department                                       | $100,000              |
         | Computers and furniture used by the Legal Department         | Legal Department                                             | $20,000               |

In addition to interest on debt used to finance operations and research and costs specific to the Manufacturing, Personnel, and Accounting Departments, Company A incurs the following costs during its 2023 taxable year:

| Description | Department(s) | Total Cost |
| ---- | ---- | ---- |
| Materials and supplies used exclusively for the research project | Research Department | $50,000 |
| Materials and supplies used by the Engineering Department | Engineering Department | $40,000 |
| Materials and supplies used by the Legal Department | Legal Department | $10,000 |
| Labor costs of Research Department employees and their direct supervisor, each of which spends 100% of their time on the research project | Research Department | $600,000 |
| Labor costs of all Engineering Department employees, each of which spends 20% of their time on the research project | Engineering Department | $200,000 |
| Labor costs of all Legal Department employees, each of which spends 10% of their time on the research project | Legal Department | $100,000 |
| Electricity for the facility | The Research Department and the Manufacturing Department consume large amounts of electricity relative to the other departments. The Research Department uses 100,000 kilowatt- hours of electricity. The Manufacturing Department uses 220,000 kilowatt- hours of electricity. The other departments each use 20,000 kilowatt- hours of electricity. | $200,000 |
| Other utilities and overhead costs for the facility | All departments benefit from such costs in proportion to square footage occupied | $100,000 |
| Other miscellaneous overhead costs incurred by the Research Department | Research Department | $50,000 |
| Other miscellaneous overhead costs incurred by the Engineering Department | Engineering Department | $50,000 |
| Other miscellaneous overhead costs incurred bythe Legal Department | Legal Department | $50,000 |

##### (b) Analysis.

Pursuant to section 4.03(1) of this notice, Company A determines that the costs described in the tables in section 4.03(4)(a) are the types of costs that are incident to SRE activities described in section 4.02(4) of this notice. Pursuant to section 4.03(2)(a) of this notice, Company A determines that the costs incurred by the Manufacturing, Personnel, and Accounting Departments are not treated as SRE expenditures because the activities of those departments are not SRE activities and such costs either do not, or only indirectly, support or benefit SRE activities. Similarly, pursuant to section 4.03(2)(b) of this notice, Company A determines that interest on debt used to finance operations and research is not treated as an SRE expenditure.

Pursuant to section 4.03(3) of this notice, Company A determines its total SRE expenditures for 2023 by allocating the costs described in the tables in section 4.03(4)(a) of this notice to its SRE activities on the basis of a cause-and-effect relationship between the costs and the SRE activities or another relationship that reasonably relates the costs to the benefits provided to the SRE activities as provided in the following table. This allocation method generally relates the costs described in the tables in section 4.03(4)(a) of this notice to SRE activities on the basis of total labor hours spent on such activities; however, for certain costs, Company A determines that a different allocation method more appropriately relates the costs to the benefits that they provide to the SRE activities, such as an allocation method based on the relative square footage of each department. As noted in section 4.03(4)(a), employees in the Research Department spent 100% of their time on SRE activities, employees in the Engineering Department spent 20% of their time on SRE activities, and employees in the Legal Department spent 10% of their time on SRE activities.
