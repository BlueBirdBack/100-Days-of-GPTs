        "\n",
        "**Prompt chaining** involves breaking down a larger task into smaller, interconnected prompts. The output of each prompt then becomes the input for the next, guiding the language model through the process step-by-step. This approach offers several benefits:\n",
        "\n",
        "*   Improved accuracy: Smaller, focused prompts can lead to better results from the language model.\n",
        "*   Debugging: It's easier to identify where things go wrong within the chain, allowing for targeted adjustments and improvements.\n",
        "*   Complex tasks: By breaking down intricate problems into manageable steps, prompt chaining enables the language model to tackle more complex tasks.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Iterative generation** refers to the process of building the desired output iteratively. In this case, we'll use it to write a story that is longer than what a single generation window allows. Iterative generation offers several benefits:\n",

        "*   Longer outputs: It allows for the creation of longer and more detailed outputs, exceeding the limitations of a single generation window.\n",
        "*   Flexibility: You can adjust and refine the output at each iteration, ensuring the story develops in the desired direction.\n",
        "*   Human-in-the-loop control: You can provide feedback and guidance at each step, ensuring the story aligns with your creative vision.\n",
