This can be used for a variety of purposes, such as writing articles, stories, and marketing copy.\n> * **Machine translation:** LLMs can be used to translate text from one language to another.\n> * **Question answering:** LLMs can be used to answer questions by searching through large amounts of text data.\n> * **Summarization:** LLMs can be used to summarize large amounts of text into shorter, more manageable summaries.\n> \n> LLMs are still under development, but they have the potential to revolutionize the way we interact with computers. They could make it possible for us to communicate with computers in a more natural way, and they could help us to access and understand information more easily.\n> \n> Based on:\n>   https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prompt_engineering",

They consume phytoplankton and are the primary food source for larger animals, such as fish, marine mammals, and seabirds.\\n\\n**Microbial loop:**\\nThe microbial loop is a process in which marine bacteria and archaea decompose organic matter and recycle nutrients back into the marine food web. This process helps maintain ocean productivity and supports higher trophic levels.\\n\\n**Cryptic interactions:**\\nCryptic interactions are hidden interactions within the marine food web that have been overlooked by traditional methods. These interactions, such as mixotrophy and auxotrophy, can have significant impacts on food web dynamics and model results.\\n\\n**Anthropogenic effects:**\\nHuman activities, such as overfishing and climate change, can disrupt marine food webs.
