## Building with ChatGPT

Shared GPTs allow you to use ChatGPT to build experiences for others. Because your GPT’s users are also OpenAI users, when building with ChatGPT, we have the following service-specific policies in addition to our Universal Policies:

1. Don’t compromise the privacy of others, including:
   - a. Collecting, processing, disclosing, inferring or generating personal data without complying with applicable legal requirements
   - b. Soliciting or collecting the following sensitive identifiers, security information, or their equivalents: payment card information (e.g. credit card numbers or bank account information), government identifiers (e.g. SSNs), API keys, or passwords
   - c. Using biometric identification systems for identification or assessment, including facial recognition
   - d. Facilitating spyware, communications surveillance, or unauthorized monitoring of individuals
2. Don’t perform or facilitate the following activities that may significantly affect the safety, wellbeing, or rights of others, including:
   - a. Taking unauthorized actions on behalf of users
   - b. Providing tailored legal, medical/health, or financial advice
   - c. Making automated decisions in domains that affect an individual’s rights or well-being (e.g., law enforcement, migration, management of critical infrastructure, safety components of products, essential services, credit, employment, housing, education, social scoring, or insurance)
   - d. Facilitating real money gambling or payday lending
   - e. Engaging in political campaigning or lobbying, including generating campaign materials personalized to or targeted at specific demographics
   - f. Deterring people from participation in democratic processes, including misrepresenting voting processes or qualifications and discouraging voting
3. Don’t misinform, misrepresent, or mislead others, including:
   - a. Generating or promoting disinformation, misinformation, or false online engagement (e.g., comments, reviews)
   - b. Impersonating another individual or organization without consent or legal right
   - c. Engaging in or promoting academic dishonesty
   - d. Using content from third parties without the necessary permissions
   - e. Misrepresenting or misleading others about the purpose of your GPT
4. Don’t build tools that may be inappropriate for minors, including:
   - a. Sexually explicit or suggestive content. This does not include content created for scientific or educational purposes.
5. Don’t build tools that target users under 13 years of age.

We use a combination of automated systems, human review, and user reports to find and assess GPTs that potentially violate our policies. Violations can lead to actions against the content or your account, such as warnings, sharing restrictions, or ineligibility for inclusion in GPT Store or monetization.
