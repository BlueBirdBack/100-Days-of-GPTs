#### Find the derivative of f(x) = x^3 + 2x^2 - 5x + 1.

#### Answer

To find the derivative of f(x) = x^3 + 2x^2 - 5x + 1, we can use the power rule of differentiation. The power rule states that if f(x) = x^n, then f'(x) = nx^(n-1). Applying this rule to each term of the function, we get:

- The derivative of x^3 is 3x^2
- The derivative of 2x^2 is 4x
- The derivative of -5x is -5
- The derivative of 1 is 0

Therefore, the derivative of f(x) = x^3 + 2x^2 - 5x + 1 is:

f'(x) = 3x^2 + 4x - 5

We can also write this in factored form as:

f'(x) = (3x + 4)(x - 5)

This means that the slope of the tangent line to the graph of f(x) at any point x is given by the expression 3x^2 + 4x - 5.
