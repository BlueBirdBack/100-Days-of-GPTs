#### how does perplexity ai compare to other ai chat tools

#### Answer

When it comes to search engine functionality, Perplexity AI is an AI-powered search engine that provides direct, up-to-date answers to user queries. It searches the web in real-time, summarizes the most relevant information, and delivers concise answers with cited sources for verification[5][10]. Perplexity AI is designed to provide accurate and reliable information, and it excels at providing search engine functionality[7]. On the other hand, ChatGPT is a language model created to hold a conversation with the end-user[11]. ChatGPT for search engines is an extension that allows users to access the ChatGPT language model directly from their search engine results to ask any question and get a natural language response[3]. ChatGPT is designed to provide detailed answers and generate text[7]. While both Perplexity AI and ChatGPT have their strengths and weaknesses, Perplexity AI is more focused on providing direct answers to user queries, while ChatGPT is more focused on generating text[7].

- 1 cup broccoli florets
- 1/2 cup snow peas, sliced in half
- 1 teaspoon cornstarch

*Marinade:*
- 1/4 cup low sodium soy sauce
- 2 tablespoons raw honey
- 2 teaspoons Sriracha hot sauce (more or less, to taste)
- 1 teaspoon ground chili with fried garlic (more or less, to taste)
- 2 cloves garlic

*Instructions:*
1. In a bowl, mix together the marinade ingredients. Add the chicken and marinate for at least 30 minutes.
2. Heat the oil in a wok or large skillet over high heat. Add the garlic and onion and stir-fry for 30 seconds.

[**If an LLM is multimodal, what does this mean?**](https://www.perplexity.ai/search/If-an-LLM-DybZ9QIwTWiTZ4OPOqyyLg)

A multimodal Large Language Model (LLM) is trained on several types of data, not just text. It combines text with other kinds of information such as images, videos, audio, and other sensory data. This helps the underlying transformer model to find and approximate the relations between different modalities. Multimodal LLMs use modules that encode not just text but other types of data into the same encoding space, enabling the model to compute all kinds of data through a single mechanism.

[**What are the anecdotal differences between GPT 4, Claude 2.1, and Perplexity's Experimental 70b Model?**](https://www.perplexity.ai/search/What-are-the-3D6jpEZuQEyUBdEjnt9ZHA)

The anecdotal differences between GPT-4, Claude 2.1, and Perplexity's Experimental 70b Model are not directly compared in the provided search results. However, we can infer some differences based on the information about GPT-4 and Claude 2.1. Multimodal Capabilities: GPT-4 can process text and has the potential to analyze images, although visual inputs are not publicly available yet. Performance: It has slightly better performance in math, reasoning, and coding skills compared to Claude 2.

[**Concepts: Perplexity Model**](https://www.perplexity.ai/search/Concepts-Perplexity-Model-cSfziEk6Q6WnO0ZQPIp5WA)

"Fine-tuned" in the context of a Large Language Model (LLM) refers to the process of further training a pre-existing model on a smaller, domain-specific dataset. Large language models like GPT series from OpenAI have already learned patterns and features on a large dataset. Fine-tuning involves adjusting the model's parameters with task-specific data while maintaining its original training knowledge.

[**Prompt vs. Search**](https://www.perplexity.ai/search/Prompt-vs-Search-6gc.ENnPSqOmop.dL1_Wfg)

A prompt and a search are two different things. Here are the differences between them: Prompt A prompt is a specific form of assistance given by an adult before or as the learner attempts to use a skill. It is direct and leads to the correct answer. It can be an instruction, gesture, demonstration, touch, or other things that we arrange or do to increase the likelihood that children will make correct responses.

[**What are Tokens in the context of AI?**](https://www.perplexity.ai/search/What-are-Tokens-9I73ftsPQPu3hYEY0Jv.lw)

In the context of AI, tokens are the basic units of text or code that AI models use to process and generate language. These tokens can be characters, words, subwords, or other segments of text or code, depending on the chosen tokenization method or scheme. Here are some key points about tokens in AI: Tokenization: Tokenization is the process of splitting input and output texts into smaller units that can be processed by AI models.

[**Models**](https://www.perplexity.ai/search/Models-YmWsMTPPSoumplE0iiPmjA)

GPT-4 Turbo and Claude 2.1 are both AI models with unique capabilities and strengths. Here are some anecdotal differences between the two: 1. Multimodal capabilities: GPT-4 Turbo can process text, images, audio, video, etc., while Claude 2.1 focuses solely on text processing. 2. Pricing: GPT-4 Turbo is designed to be more affordable than GPT-4, with pricing at $0.01 per 1,000 tokens for input and $0.03 per 1,000 for output.

[**Prompting with Perplexity**](https://www.perplexity.ai/search/Prompting-with-Perplexity-MFAwerIIRny_i41Of8SnYw)

A prompt is a starting point for a conversation with a computer program, like an AI, to get it to do something for you. It's like asking a question or giving a command to the program to set the stage for what you want to know or get done. A prompt can be thought of as asking a chef for a specific dish - you'll get what you ask for, so it's important to be clear and specific.

[**What is the definition of AI and how does it differ from machine learning?**](https://www.perplexity.ai/search/What-is-the-vXcs7SfJQEe7lKsO6q2AzQ)

Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning (ML) are often used interchangeably, but they are actually distinct concepts. AI is the broader term that refers to the general ability of computers to emulate human thought and perform tasks in real-world environments. On the other hand, ML is a subset of AI that uses algorithms trained on data to produce models that can perform complex tasks.

[**LLM's**](https://www.perplexity.ai/search/LLMs-be.H.sBPT2Kd00RtI7_qZg)

A Large Language Model (LLM) is a type of artificial intelligence (AI) algorithm that uses deep learning techniques and massive data sets to understand and generate human-like responses to natural language queries. LLMs are characterized by their large size, which can range from a billion to a trillion weights. They are artificial neural networks that are pre-trained using self-supervised learning and semi-supervised learning.

[**Prompting**](https://www.perplexity.ai/search/Prompting-tCivmWOuRxqozPa11u3smA)
