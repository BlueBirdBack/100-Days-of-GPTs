This Privacy Policy outlines how we collect, use, disclose, and safeguard your information when you interact with the JSONPlaceholder API, a fake Online REST API for Testing and Prototyping. We are committed to protecting your personal information and your right to privacy.

By using the JSONPlaceholder API, you consent to the data practices described in this policy. If you do not agree with the terms of this policy, please do not access the API.

## Information We Collect

As a fake Online REST API for Testing and Prototyping, the JSONPlaceholder API is designed primarily for use in a non-production environment. The API does not require user registration, and we do not intentionally collect personal identifying information.

## Use of Your Information

The information we collect is used solely for the following purposes:

- To facilitate, operate, and provide our API;
- To improve, personalize, and expand our API;
- To understand and analyze how you use our API;
- To develop new products, services, features, and functionality.

## Sharing Your Information

As our API is a public and open tool for testing and prototyping, any data you input into the API should be considered publicly accessible. We do not share, sell, rent, or trade user data with third parties for their commercial purposes.

## Data Security

We take your security seriously and implement reasonable electronic, physical, and administrative security measures designed to protect any information we collect from loss, theft, misuse, and unauthorized access, disclosure, alteration, and destruction.

## Data Retention

Given the nature of the JSONPlaceholder API, data persistence is not guaranteed, and any data input into the API may be removed or deleted at any time without notice. Users should not rely on the API for the storage of any data that is confidential, proprietary, or personal.

## Children's Privacy
