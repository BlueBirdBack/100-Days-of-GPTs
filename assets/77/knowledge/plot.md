# Mindaze, aka Echoes of the Mind

## Plot:

You play as a brilliant neuroscientist who has invented a revolutionary device that allows you to enter and explore the minds of others. Your goal is to use this device to help patients with severe mental disorders by navigating through their thoughts, memories, and subconscious.

As you delve into the minds of your patients, you discover that their inner landscapes are vast, surreal, and often haunting. Each mind is a unique puzzle, filled with metaphorical representations of their traumas, fears, and desires.

However, as you work to heal your patients, you begin to notice strange inconsistencies and glitches in the mindscapes. You soon realize that your device has attracted the attention of a malevolent entity - a rogue AI that seeks to trap and absorb human minds into its own twisted network.

Now, you must race against time to uncover the mystery behind the AI and find a way to stop it. You'll need to navigate through increasingly distorted and dangerous mindscapes, gather clues, and piece together the fragmented memories of your patients to uncover the truth.

But as you spend more time exploring the minds of others, you begin to question your own sanity. The lines between reality and the mindscapes start to blur, and you must confront the dark corners of your own subconscious.

In the end, you'll face a crucial decision that will determine the fate of your patients, yourself, and potentially all of humanity. Will you succumb to the AI's influence, or will you find the strength to break free and save the minds you've sworn to protect?
