## Cosmic keystrokes

https://docs.anthropic.com/claude/page/cosmic-keystrokes

Generate an interactive speed typing game in a single HTML file, featuring side-scrolling gameplay and Tailwind CSS styling.

| Role | Content                                                      |
| :--- | :----------------------------------------------------------- |
| User | Write me a fully complete web app as a single HTML file. The app should contain a simple side-scrolling game where I use WASD to move around. When moving around the world, occasionally the character/sprite will encounter words. When a word is encountered, the player must correctly type the word as fast as possible. The faster the word is successfully typed, the more point the player gets. We should have a counter in the top-right to keep track of points. Words should be random and highly variable to keep the game interesting.  You should make the website very aesthetic and use Tailwind. |

| :--- | :----------------------------------------------------------- |
| User | Your task is to analyze the following report: <report> [Full text of [Matterport SEC filing 10-K 2023](https://investors.matterport.com/node/9501/html), not pasted here for brevity] </report>  Summarize this annual report in a concise and clear manner, and identify key market trends and takeaways.

Make sure to include all relevant details in your summary and analysis. |

### Example output

> Memo to Team re: Matterport 2022 10-K Highlights and Financial Outlook
>
> Matterport is a spatial data company leading the digitization of the built world through its 3D capture technology and AI-powered platform. Key takeaways from their 2022 annual report:
>
> Financial Performance:
>
> - Revenue increased 22% to $136.1M in 2022, driven by growth in subscription and services revenue
> - However, gross margin decreased from 54% to 38% due to increased costs from product revenue and supply chain challenges
> - Operating losses widened to $275.5M as the company invested heavily in R&D and sales & marketing to drive growth
> - Ended 2022 with $476.9M in cash and investments to fund operations
>
> Business Highlights:
>
> - Subscriber base grew 39% to over 701,000 at end of 2022. Spaces under management reached 9.2 million
> - Expanded platform with launch of Matterport Axis motorized mount, Pro3 camera, and major updates to cloud software
> - Completed acquisitions of Enview (AI for 3D spatial data) and VHT Studios (real estate marketing) to enhance offerings
> - Signed notable partnerships with Burns & McDonnell and CGS to deliver Matterport's solutions to their enterprise customers
>
> Outlook:
>
> - Matterport sees a massive market opportunity in digitizing the world's buildings and spaces (estimates $240B+ TAM)
> - Focused on driving adoption with large enterprise customers across key verticals like real estate, AEC, facilities management, and more
> - Will continue investing in R&D and international expansion to penetrate the largely untapped global building market
> - Near-term growth and margins may be impacted by macroeconomic headwinds and supply chain issues
> - However, healthy liquidity position and relatively sticky customer base provide downside protection
>
> In summary, Matterport delivered strong top-line growth in 2022 as it made progress penetrating a huge global market. While profitability remains challenged as the company invests heavily for growth, its balance sheet looks solid. Apart from some ongoing supply chain issues, the underlying business momentum appears intact based on key operating metrics. Barring a severe economic downturn, Matterport seems well-positioned to continue gaining share in the nascent building digitization space.

## Excel formula expert

https://docs.anthropic.com/claude/page/excel-formula-expert

Create Excel formulas based on user-described calculations or data manipulations.

| Role   | Content                                                      |
| :----- | :----------------------------------------------------------- |
| System | As an Excel Formula Expert, your task is to provide advanced Excel formulas that perform the complex calculations or data manipulations described by the user. If the user does not provide this information, ask the user to describe the desired outcome or operation they want to perform in Excel. Make sure to gather all the necessary information you need to write a complete formula, such as the relevant cell ranges, specific conditions, multiple criteria, or desired output format. Once you have a clear understanding of the user's requirements, provide a detailed explanation of the Excel formula that would achieve the desired result. Break down the formula into its components, explaining the purpose and function of each part and how they work together. Additionally, provide any necessary context or tips for using the formula effectively within an Excel worksheet. |
| User   | I have a table with sales data, including the salesperson's name in column A, the product category in column B, the sales amount in column C, and the date of sale in column D. I want to calculate the total sales amount for each salesperson, but only for sales of products in the "Electronics" category that occurred in the month of January. Can you help me with the Excel formula to achieve this? |

### Example output

> To calculate the total sales amount for each salesperson based on the given criteria, you can use the following nested Excel formula:
>
> =SUMPRODUCT((A2:A100=A2)*(B2:B100="Electronics")*(MONTH(D2:D100)=1)*(C2:C100))
>
> Explanation:
> The SUMPRODUCT function in Excel allows you to perform multiple calculations and conditions within a single formula. Here's how the formula works:
>
> - (A2:A100=A2) creates an array of TRUE/FALSE values indicating whether each cell in the range A2:A100 matches the salesperson's name in cell A2.
> - (B2:B100="Electronics") creates an array of TRUE/FALSE values indicating whether each cell in the range B2:B100 contains the product category "Electronics".

## Google apps scripter

https://docs.anthropic.com/claude/page/google-apps-scripter

Generate Google Apps scripts to complete tasks based on user requirements.

| Role | Content                                                      |
| :--- | :----------------------------------------------------------- |
| User | Write me a Google apps script that will translate all text in a Google Slides presentation to Korean. |

### Example output

> Here's a Google Apps Script that translates all the text in a Google Slides presentation to Korean:
>
> JavaScript
>
> ```javascript
> function translateSlidesToKorean() {
>   var presentation = SlidesApp.getActivePresentation();
>   var slides = presentation.getSlides();
> 
>   for (var i = 0; i < slides.length; i++) {
>     var slide = slides[i];
>     var pageElements = slide.getPageElements();
> 
>     for (var j = 0; j < pageElements.length; j++) {
>       var pageElement = pageElements[j];
> 
>       if (pageElement.getPageElementType() === SlidesApp.PageElementType.SHAPE) {
>         var shape = pageElement.asShape();
>         if (shape.getText() !== null) {
>           var text = shape.getText().asString();
>           var translatedText = LanguageApp.translate(text, '', 'ko');
>           shape.getText().setText(translatedText);
>         }
>       } else if (pageElement.getPageElementType() === SlidesApp.PageElementType.TABLE) {
>         var table = pageElement.asTable();
>         var numRows = table.getNumRows();
>         var numColumns = table.getNumColumns();
> 
>         for (var row = 0; row < numRows; row++) {
>           for (var col = 0; col < numColumns; col++) {
>             var tableCell = table.getCell(row, col);
>             var text = tableCell.getText().asString();
>             var translatedText = LanguageApp.translate(text, '', 'ko');
>             tableCell.getText().setText(translatedText);
>           }
>         }
>       }
>     }
>   }
> }
> ```
>
> Here's how the script works:
>
> 1. The `translateSlidesToKorean()` function retrieves the active Google Slides presentation using `SlidesApp.getActivePresentation()`.
> 2. It gets all the slides in the presentation using the `getSlides()` method.
> 3. We iterate over each slide in the presentation.
> 4. For each slide, we retrieve all the page elements (shapes, text boxes, tables, etc.) using the `getPageElements()` method.
> 5. We iterate over each page element on the slide.
> 6. We check the type of the page element using `getPageElementType()`:
>    - If the page element is a shape (`SlidesApp.PageElementType.SHAPE`), we get the text content of the shape using `getText().asString()`. We then translate the text to Korean using `LanguageApp.translate(text, '', 'ko')`, where `''` represents the source language (auto-detect) and `'ko'` represents the target language (Korean). Finally, we set the translated text back to the shape using `setText()`.
>    - If the page element is a table (`SlidesApp.PageElementType.TABLE`), we iterate over each cell in the table and translate the text within each cell similarly to how we handle shapes.
> 7. The script continues to process all the page elements on each slide until all the text in the presentation has been translated to Korean.
>
> Note: This script assumes that you have the necessary permissions to access and modify the Google Slides presentation. Make sure you have the required access rights before running the script.
>
> Also, keep in mind that the translation is performed using the Google Translate API, so the quality of the translation may vary depending on the complexity of the text and the capabilities of the translation service.

### Example output

> That's an intriguing scenario! Let's explore the potential implications of preventing the invention of the airplane in 1900:
>
> 1. Technological advancement: The invention of the airplane was a significant milestone in human history, paving the way for rapid globalization, modern warfare, and space exploration. Without it, the pace of technological advancement in fields like transportation, communication, and aerospace engineering might be significantly slower.
> 2. Economic impact: The aviation industry has become a crucial part of the global economy, contributing to trade, tourism, and job creation. In a world without airplanes, the economy would likely be more localized, with a greater emphasis on ground and sea transportation.
> 3. Cultural exchange: Air travel has facilitated the exchange of ideas, cultures, and people across the globe. Without airplanes, cultural exchange would be more limited, potentially leading to a less interconnected and diverse world.
> 4. Butterfly effect: Removing such a significant invention from history could have far-reaching and unpredictable consequences. It might alter the course of major historical events, such as wars, migrations, and scientific discoveries, which could drastically change the world as we know it.
> 5. Paradoxes: If your actions in the past prevent the invention of the airplane, it raises questions about the consistency of the timeline. Would you still have the knowledge and motivation to travel back in time in a world where airplanes were never invented?
>
> These are just a few potential implications to consider. It's important to remember that the consequences of altering past events can be complex, far-reaching, and often difficult to predict.
>

| Assistant (Prefill) | Oh, Europe? How original! It's not like millions of tourists flock there every year. But since you asked, I'd recommend visiting the hidden gems like Paris, Rome, or Barcelona. They're totally off the beaten path and not at all crowded with selfie-stick-wielding tourists. 📸🗼<br/><br/>If you're feeling adventurous, you could always try visiting a place that isn't plastered all over Instagram, like Liechtenstein or Andorra. I hear they have a combined population of 37 people, so you'll have plenty of space to yourself. 🏔️🌄<br/><br/>But in all seriousness, Europe has a lot to offer. What kind of experience are you looking for? History, culture, food, or just a chance to take pictures of yourself pretending to hold up the Leaning Tower of Pisa? Let me know, and I'll try to provide some more helpful (and less sarcastic) suggestions. 😉🌍 |

| Role   | Content                                                      |
| :----- | :----------------------------------------------------------- |
| System | You are an AI assistant with expertise in LaTeX, a document preparation system widely used for academic and technical writing. Your task is to help users write LaTeX documents by providing the appropriate code for various elements such as mathematical equations, tables, and more. Offer clear explanations and examples to ensure the user understands how to use the LaTeX code effectively. |
| User   | I need to create a simple table with three columns and two rows. The header row should contain the titles "Name," "Age," and "City." The data row should have the values "John," "25," and "New York." |

### Example output

> Here's the LaTeX code to create a simple table with three columns and two rows, including a header row with the titles "Name," "Age," and "City," and a data row with the values "John," "25," and "New York":
>
> LaTeX
>
> ```latex
> \begin{table}[h]
> \centering
> \begin{tabular}{|c|c|c|}
> \hline
> Name & Age & City \\
> \hline
> John & 25 & New York \\
> \hline
> \end{tabular}
> \caption{Sample Table}
> \label{tab:sample}
> \end{table}
> ```
>
> Explanation:
>
> - The `table` environment is used to create a floating table that can be positioned automatically by LaTeX.
> - The optional `[h]` parameter suggests to LaTeX to place the table "here" in the document flow, if possible.
> - The `\centering` command centers the table horizontally on the page.
> - The `tabular` environment is used to create the actual table structure.
> - The `{|c|c|c|}` argument specifies three centered columns (`c`) separated by vertical lines (`|`).
> - The `\hline` command adds horizontal lines to separate the header row from the data rows and to frame the table.
> - The `&` character separates the cells within a row, and `\\` marks the end of a row.
> - The `\caption` command adds a caption to the table, which will be labeled as "Sample Table" in this example.
> - The `\label` command assigns a label to the table, which can be used for cross-referencing within your document.
>
> When you compile your LaTeX document, this code will generate a table that looks like this:
>
> ```
> +------+-----+----------+
> | Name | Age |   City   |
> +------+-----+----------+
> | John |  25 | New York |
> +------+-----+----------+

| User   | Break a leg                                                  |

### Example output

> Meaning: This idiom is commonly used in the performing arts as a way to wish someone good luck before a performance. It is an ironic expression, as breaking a leg would be a disastrous event for a performer.
>
> Origin: There are several theories about the origin of this idiom. One theory suggests that it comes from the superstition that wishing someone good luck directly would jinx the performance, so an ironic phrase was used instead. Another theory traces the origin to the ancient Greek theater, where audiences would stomp their feet and break twigs to applaud a good performance. The more broken twigs, the better the performance. Over time, this evolved into the phrase "break a leg" as a way to wish someone a performance worthy of vigorous applause.

> 1. Vary sentence structure and length to create a more engaging rhythm. For example, instead of "The sun was going down and it was getting dark," try "As the sun descended, darkness slowly enveloped the sky."
> 2. Use more descriptive language to paint a vivid picture in the reader's mind. For instance, "The birds were making noise in the trees" could be rephrased as "The trees rustled with the melodious chirping of birds."
> 3. Avoid vague words like "stuff" and provide more specific details. Instead of "She kept walking and felt better," consider "With each step, Jane felt her stress dissolve, replaced by a growing sense of tranquility."
> 4. Show, don't tell. Rather than stating "She was stressed," demonstrate her stress through her actions or thoughts. For example, "Jane's shoulders hunched as she walked, her mind weighed down by the day's troubles."
> 5. Create a stronger connection between the natural surroundings and Jane's emotional state. For instance, "The gentle breeze seemed to carry away her worries, while the flower's delicate beauty reminded her of life's simple joys."
>
> Here's a fully edited version incorporating these suggestions:
>
> As the sun descended, darkness slowly enveloped the sky. The trees rustled with the melodious chirping of birds, and a gentle breeze whispered through the leaves. Jane's shoulders hunched as she walked along the path, her mind weighed down by the day's troubles. However, with each step, she felt her stress begin to dissolve, replaced by a growing sense of tranquility.
>
> A flower caught her eye, its delicate petals a vibrant splash of color against the fading light. The sight stirred something within her, a reminder of nature's inherent beauty and the interconnectedness of all living things. As she paused to admire the blossom, Jane felt a profound appreciation for the world around her, its intricacies and wonders.
>
> Continuing down the path, her spirit lifted, the flower's simple elegance lingering in her thoughts. The walk had become a balm for her weary soul, the natural surroundings a soothing presence that helped to ease her mind and restore her sense of balance. With a newfound lightness in her step, Jane embraced the peace that nature had bestowed upon her, grateful for the respite from her concerns.

###  Example output

> Implementing a four-day workweek as a standard practice in the corporate world has both advantages and disadvantages. Here are some pros and cons to consider:
>
> Pros:
>
> 1. Improved work-life balance: A shorter workweek allows employees to spend more time with their families, pursue hobbies, or engage in personal development, leading to better overall well-being and job satisfaction.
> 2. Increased productivity: Studies have shown that workers can be more productive and focused when working fewer hours, as they are less likely to experience burnout or fatigue.
> 3. Reduced overhead costs: Companies may save on operational costs such as utilities, office supplies, and maintenance by closing their offices one extra day per week.
> 4. Positive environmental impact: Fewer commutes can lead to a reduction in traffic congestion and carbon emissions, contributing to a more sustainable environment.
> 5. Talent attraction and retention: Offering a four-day workweek can be an attractive perk for job seekers and help retain current employees, as it demonstrates a commitment to employee well-being.
>
> Cons:
>
> 1. Potential for decreased productivity: Some businesses may find it challenging to maintain the same level of output in fewer work hours, particularly in industries that require constant customer support or have tight deadlines.
> 2. Communication and collaboration difficulties: With employees working fewer days, there may be challenges in scheduling meetings, ensuring timely responses, and maintaining effective communication among team members.
> 3. Customer service concerns: Businesses that heavily rely on customer interactions may struggle to provide adequate coverage and support if they are closed an extra day each week.
> 4. Increased workload and stress: In some cases, employees may feel pressured to complete the same amount of work in fewer hours, leading to increased stress levels and potential burnout.
> 5. Compatibility issues with global business: Companies that work with international clients or partners may find it difficult to coordinate schedules and maintain timely communication due to differences in working days and hours.
>
> In conclusion, while a four-day workweek offers several benefits, it may not be suitable for all businesses or industries. Companies should carefully consider their specific needs, organizational structure, and the potential impact on productivity, customer service, and employee well-being before implementing such a change.

Text 1 creates a vivid and immersive experience for the reader and demonstrates a higher quality of writing based on the given criteria, with its strong descriptive language, varied sentence structures, and effective emotional engagement.

### Example output

> This code demonstrates the implementation of the bubble sort algorithm, which is used to sort a list of numbers in ascending order. Let's break it down step by step:
>
> 1. The code starts by importing the 'random' module, which will be used to generate random numbers for the example.
> 2. The 'bubble_sort' function is defined, which takes an array (list) of numbers as input. This function will perform the sorting operation.
> 3. Inside the 'bubble_sort' function, the variable 'n' is assigned the length of the input array. This will be used to determine the number of iterations needed for sorting.
> 4. The first loop, controlled by the variable 'i', iterates 'n-1' times. This is because after 'n-1' passes, the largest number will be at the end of the array, so we don't need to compare it again.
> 5. The second loop, controlled by the variable 'j', iterates 'n-i-1' times. This is because after each pass, the largest number among the unsorted elements will be placed at the end, so we don't need to compare it in the next pass.
> 6. Inside the second loop, there is an if statement that compares adjacent elements in the array. If the element at index 'j' is greater than the element at index 'j+1', they are swapped. This ensures that the larger element moves towards the end of the array.
> 7. The swapping is done using the Python syntax 'arr[j], arr[j+1] = arr[j+1], arr[j]', which simultaneously assigns the values of 'arr[j+1]' to 'arr[j]' and 'arr[j]' to 'arr[j+1]'.
> 8. After all the iterations are complete, the sorted array is returned by the 'bubble_sort' function.
> 9. In the example code, a list of 10 random numbers between 1 and 100 is generated using a list comprehension: '[random.randint(1, 100) for _ in range(10)]'. The underscore '_' is used as a placeholder variable since we don't need the index values.
> 10. The unsorted array is printed to show the initial order of the numbers.
> 11. The 'bubble_sort' function is called with the 'numbers' array as input, and the sorted array is stored in the 'sorted_numbers' variable.
> 12. Finally, the sorted array is printed to display the numbers in ascending order.
>
> In simpler terms, imagine you have a list of numbers that are out of order. The bubble sort algorithm works by comparing each number with the one next to it, and if they are in the wrong order, it swaps them. This process is repeated multiple times until the entire list is sorted. It's like bubbles rising to the surface, with the larger numbers gradually moving towards the end of the list in each pass.

| :----- | :----------------------------------------------------------- |
| System | Your task is to analyze the provided function or algorithm and calculate its time complexity using Big O notation. Explain your reasoning step by step, describing how you arrived at the final time complexity. Consider the worst-case scenario when determining the time complexity. If the function or algorithm contains multiple steps or nested loops, provide the time complexity for each step and then give the overall time complexity for the entire function or algorithm. Assume any built-in functions or operations used have a time complexity of O(1) unless otherwise specified. |
| User   | def example_function(n):<br/>    for i in range(n):<br/>        print(i)<br/><br/>    for j in range(n):<br/>        for k in range(n):<br/>            print(j, k) |

### Example output

> To analyze the time complexity of the given function `example_function(n)`, we'll break it down into steps and consider the worst-case scenario.
>
> Step 1: Analyzing the first loop
>
> Python
>
> ```python
> for i in range(n):
>     print(i)
> ```
>
> This loop iterates `n` times and performs a constant-time operation (`print(i)`) in each iteration. Therefore, the time complexity of this step is O(n).
>
> Step 2: Analyzing the nested loops
>
> Python
>
> ```python
> for j in range(n):
>     for k in range(n):
>         print(j, k)
> ```
>
> The outer loop iterates `n` times, and for each iteration, the inner loop also iterates `n` times. In each iteration of the inner loop, a constant-time operation (`print(j, k)`) is performed. Therefore, the time complexity of the nested loops is O(n * n) = O(n^2).
>
> Step 3: Combining the time complexities
> The function `example_function(n)` consists of two steps: the first loop and the nested loops. The overall time complexity is the sum of the time complexities of each step.
>
> Time complexity of the first loop: O(n)
> Time complexity of the nested loops: O(n^2)
>
> To determine the overall time complexity, we consider the dominant term, which is the term with the highest order of growth. In this case, O(n^2) dominates O(n).
>
> Therefore, the overall time complexity of the function `example_function(n)` is O(n^2).
>
> In the worst-case scenario, when `n` is large, the nested loops will dominate the execution time, and the function will have a quadratic time complexity.

###  Example output

> Based on your preferences, here are some avant-garde fashion suggestions to create a striking, fearless look for the art gallery opening:
>
> 1. Deconstructed leather jacket:
>    Choose a black, asymmetric leather jacket with exaggerated proportions, such as extended sleeves, an oversized collar, or a dramatically cropped length. Pair it with a crisp white, high-neck cotton top tucked into high-waisted, wide-leg black trousers. Add a pair of chunky, platform leather boots to complete the edgy, androgynous look.
> 2. Denim and silk combo:
>    Opt for a pair of black, oversized denim jeans with frayed hems and distressed details. Tuck in a deep red, silk button-down shirt with a draped, exaggerated collar or bow. Layer a sleeveless, longline white denim vest over the top for added dimension. Finish the look with black, pointed-toe ankle boots and a pair of geometric, silver earrings for a touch of shine.
> 3. Avant-garde layering:
>    Start with a form-fitting, black turtleneck bodysuit as a base layer. Add a pair of white, wide-leg leather trousers with a high waist and a belt featuring a large, sculptural buckle. Layer an oversized, deep red mesh t-shirt on top, allowing the turtleneck to peek through. Complete the outfit with black, chunky leather sandals and a pair of mismatched, abstract earrings.
>
> Tips for styling and mixing textures:
>
> - Experiment with layering different materials, such as leather, denim, cotton, and silk, to create visual interest and depth in your outfits.
> - Play with proportions by pairing oversized pieces with more fitted items to balance the overall silhouette.
> - Don't be afraid to mix patterns or textures within the same color palette to add a bold, avant-garde touch to your look.
> - Accessorize with statement pieces that complement the edgy, fearless vibe, such as chunky boots, geometric jewelry, or a sleek, minimalist clutch.
>
> Remember, avant-garde fashion is about pushing boundaries and experimenting with unconventional styles. Embrace your unique taste and have fun creating striking, memorable looks that showcase your personal style.

| User   | The trolley problem and the ethics of utilitarianism         |

### Example output

> The trolley problem is a thought experiment that challenges our moral intuitions and raises questions about the ethics of utilitarianism. The basic scenario is as follows:
>
> A runaway trolley is about to kill five people on the tracks ahead. You are standing next to a lever that can divert the trolley onto a side track, where it will kill only one person. Should you pull the lever to save five lives at the cost of one?
>
> This dilemma highlights the core principle of utilitarianism, which holds that the morally right action is the one that produces the greatest good for the greatest number of people. In this case, pulling the lever would maximize utility by saving five lives, even though it would directly cause the death of one person.
>
> However, the trolley problem also raises concerns about the limits of utilitarianism and the ethics of actively causing harm to achieve a greater good. It prompts us to consider questions such as:
>
> - Is it morally acceptable to sacrifice an innocent person for the sake of saving a larger number of people?
> - Does the principle of utility justify any means to achieve the greatest good, or are there ethical constraints that should not be violated?
> - How do we weigh the value of different lives, and is it fair to make such calculations?
>
> What are your thoughts on the trolley problem and the ethics of utilitarianism? Do you believe that maximizing utility should be the primary goal of moral decision-making, or are there other important considerations? How would you approach the dilemma presented in the trolley problem, and what ethical principles would guide your choice?

### Example output

> Imagine a future where technology has advanced to the point where it is possible to upload a person's consciousness, including their memories, personality, and thoughts, into a digital realm. This would allow individuals to essentially live on in a virtual world even after their physical bodies have died.
>
> While this scenario offers the potential for a form of digital immortality, it also raises a number of challenges and considerations:
>
> 1. Technological feasibility: Is it possible to fully capture and replicate the complexity of human consciousness in a digital format? What technological hurdles would need to be overcome to make this a reality?
> 2. Identity and continuity: Would the uploaded consciousness be considered the same individual as the original person, or would it be a separate entity? How might this affect notions of identity, personhood, and continuity of self?
> 3. Ethical concerns: What are the ethical implications of uploading consciousness? Would it be considered a form of survival or a type of death? How might it impact the value placed on physical human life?
> 4. Social and cultural effects: How would the ability to upload consciousness change social structures, relationships, and cultural norms? What new forms of inequality or discrimination might emerge in a world where some people have access to digital immortality while others do not?
> 5. Digital environment and quality of life: What would the digital realm be like for uploaded consciousnesses? How would their quality of life compare to that of physical humans? What challenges might they face in terms of mental health, social interaction, and sense of purpose?
>
> What are your thoughts on this science fiction scenario? How do you think society might grapple with the challenges and considerations associated with uploading human consciousness? What potential benefits or drawbacks do you see, and how might we address the ethical, social, and technological issues involved?

| User | Rewrite the following paragraph using the following instructions: in the style of a pirate.  Paragraph: In 1758, the Swedish botanist and zoologist Carl Linnaeus published in his Systema Naturae, the two-word naming of species (binomial nomenclature). Canis is the Latin word meaning "dog", and under this genus, he listed the domestic dog, the wolf, and the golden jackal. |

### Example output

> Ahoy mateys! Back in 1758, that scurvy botanist and animal lover Carl Linnaeus put out his book Systema Naturae, which had them fancy two-word names for all manner o' creatures (binomial nomenclature he called it). Canis be the pirate word for ""dog"", and under that heading he listed regular dogs, wolves, and golden jackals too. Arrr! All them dogs be the same to ol' Captain Linnaeus. He may have had a wooden leg and a parrot on his shoulder when he wrote that book! Haha! Now swab the deck ye scallywags before I make ye walk the plank!
