## How to Use?

### Example 1

***Prompt:** BTC, ETH, SOL, TAO*

**Crypto Wallet Seek:** Based on your interest in BTC, ETH, SOL, and TAO, I've identified a variety of popular and well-regarded cryptocurrency wallets that support these assets, except for TAO, for which specific wallet information was not directly available in the sources I consulted. It's worth noting that TAO might be a less common cryptocurrency, and you might need to look for wallets that specifically mention support for it or consider storing it in a wallet that supports multiple and less common cryptocurrencies.

Here's a summary of some of the best cryptocurrency wallets that support BTC, ETH, and SOL, and potentially TAO if they support a wide range of assets:

| **Wallet**         | **Type**        | **Key Features**                                                                                                                                                          | **Supported Cryptocurrencies**           |
|--------------------|-----------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------|
| Crypto.com DeFi Wallet | Hot Wallet      | Decentralized finance focused, integrates with Ledger, supports over 1,000 assets, staking/DeFi support.„Äê6‚Ä†source„Äë                                                              | BTC, ETH, SOL, +1,000 more               |
| Exodus             | Software Wallet | User-friendly, integrates with Trezor, supports about 300 cryptocurrencies, staking available.„Äê6‚Ä†source„Äë„Äê8‚Ä†source„Äë                                                         | BTC, ETH, SOL, +300 more                 |
| Trust Wallet       | Mobile Wallet   | Supports a vast number of assets and blockchains, open-source, can convert to cold storage.„Äê6‚Ä†source„Äë                                                                    | BTC, ETH, SOL, +10 million digital assets |
| Ledger Nano S Plus | Hardware Wallet | Cold storage, supports over 1,800 cryptocurrencies, secure offline storage, competitively priced.„Äê10‚Ä†source„Äë                                                             | BTC, ETH, SOL, +1,800 more               |
| Phantom Wallet     | Software Wallet | Optimized for Solana ecosystem, supports Solana NFTs and tokens, user-friendly.„Äê9‚Ä†source„Äë                                                                                | Primarily SOL and Solana ecosystem       |

For TAO, if it's a specific or less common cryptocurrency, I recommend checking if it's supported by wallets like Trust Wallet or Guarda, as these wallets support a vast number of digital assets and could potentially accommodate it.

When choosing a wallet, consider whether you prefer a hot wallet for ease of access and frequent transactions or a cold wallet for increased security and long-term holding. Each wallet type has its benefits depending on your needs and the level of security you're comfortable with. Hardware wallets like the Ledger Nano S Plus offer robust security by keeping your assets offline, while software wallets like Exodus and Trust Wallet provide convenience and ease of use for active trading and access to a wide range of assets.

Please check the respective wallet websites or contact their support for the most up-to-date information on specific cryptocurrency support, especially for less common assets like TAO.
