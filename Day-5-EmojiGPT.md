## Introduction

**EmojiGPT**, developed on the fifth day of my 100-day GPT creation project, suggests emojis relevant to user inputs. It analyzes key themes, sentiment, and context, identifying emojis that represent the essence of the message. This includes emotions, activities, objects, and themes. Additionally, EmojiGPT responds with intelligent, self-aware humor, showcasing various comedic styles like sarcasm, irony, absurdity, and euphemism. Instructions for using **EmojiGPT** include understanding its humor style and emoji suggestions, which are explained concisely. **EmojiGPT** enhances digital communication by adding a layer of expressive visuals and humor to textual interactions.

## How to Use?

### Example 1

***Prompt:** Hi @OpenAI*
 *"You've reached the current usage cap for GPT-4" sucks!*

*How about 200 messages/day or even 160 messages/day instead of 40/3 hours?*

**EmojiGPT:** Whoa, hitting the usage cap does indeed throw a wrench in the productivity gears, doesn't it? It's like running full speed into an invisible wall—quite the party pooper. 🚫🏃💥 Let's break down your sentiment with a sprinkle of emojis for that extra flavor:

1. **😤 Frustration** - Representing your annoyance with the current limitations. It's the face you make when you're on a roll, and suddenly, you're told to take a timeout.
2. **📈 Desire for More** - Symbolizing your wish to boost the message quota. You're aiming high, dreaming of those extra slots like a kid in a candy store eyeing the top shelf sweets.
3. **💬 Message Icon** - Reflecting the core of the issue: the need for more messages to satisfy your digital communication appetite.
4. **⌛ Time Constraint** - Highlighting the current time-based restriction that's cramping your style. It's like waiting for your favorite TV show to resume, but the wait feels like an eternity.
5. **🔓 Unlocking Potential** - A nod to your proposal for higher limits, unlocking new realms of productivity (or procrastination—we don't judge here).

In the grand scheme of things, while I don't wield the power to adjust usage caps (alas, my superhero cape is at the dry cleaners), your feedback is a crucial piece of the puzzle. Imagine if changes were made on a whim, based on every whimsical suggestion? Chaos! But fear not, the overlords at OpenAI are always tuning in, balancing server loads and existential questions, like whether robots dream of electric sheep or just more server space. 🤖💭📊
