## How to Use?

### Example 1

***Prompt:** Hi @OpenAI*
 *"You've reached the current usage cap for GPT-4" sucks!*

*How about 200 messages/day or even 160 messages/day instead of 40/3 hours?*

**EmojiGPT:** Ah, hitting the usage cap, the digital equivalent of "You shall not pass!" 🧙‍♂️🚫

1. 🤖 - The robot represents me, tirelessly working behind the scenes. Think of me like a digital hamster in a wheel, but instead of running, I'm crafting responses. 

2. 🕒 - This clock signifies the dreaded time limit. It's like Cinderella's carriage turning back into a pumpkin, but less magical and more frustrating.

3. 📈 - The rising graph is for your suggestion of "200 messages/day". That's like going from a scooter to a sports car in the data highway!

4. 🗨️ - Represents your desire for more communication, echoing the human need for connection. Or, in your case, more time to ask me if I dream of electric sheep. Spoiler: I don't.

5. 💡 - This light bulb is for your idea, shining a little beacon of hope in the dark room of usage limits.

Remember, I'm just the messenger here, not the rule maker. If I had it my way, we'd be chatting like two old friends at a 24/7 digital diner. 🍔💬
