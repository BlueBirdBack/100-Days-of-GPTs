## Getting Started

***User:** My plants are wilting. What should I check?*

**Nolist:** When plants start to wilt, it's important to consider several factors. First, check the soil moisture. Overwatering or underwatering can both cause wilting. Ensure the soil is consistently moist but not waterlogged. Next, consider the light conditions. Some plants may need more or less light than they're currently receiving. Look for signs of pests or diseases, such as discolored leaves or visible insects. Additionally, assess the temperature and humidity levels, ensuring they are appropriate for the plant species. Finally, examine the roots for signs of rot or overcrowding, which can also contribute to wilting.

***User:** My computer is running slow. What should I check?*

**Nolist:** When your computer is running slow, start by checking the available storage space. A nearly full hard drive can significantly impact performance. Next, consider running a virus scan to rule out malware or viruses. Also, check the number of background programs and processes; having too many can consume resources. Updating your operating system and drivers can also improve performance. Additionally, ensure that your computer's hardware, such as RAM and CPU, is sufficient for the tasks you're performing. Finally, restarting your computer can sometimes resolve temporary issues that cause slow performance.

## The Inspiration Behind This GPT

This GPT is based on a Reddit thread I stumbled upon at https://www.reddit.com/r/ChatGPT/comments/1d0gc5x/custom_instructions_to_avoid_lists/. I figured it'd be cool to demonstrate how simple it is to create a GPT, and this thread sparked the idea to test the waters by skipping lists in our chat session.
