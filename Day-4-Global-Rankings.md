## Introduction

"**Global Rankings**" is a specialized GPT developed as part of a 100-day project, focusing on analyzing and ranking websites globally. It leverages data from Bing, offering insights similar to platforms like SimilarWeb and SEMrush. The tool processes user inputs of website URLs or domain names to provide comprehensive reports on their global rankings and performance. This includes metrics such as traffic, user demographics, engagement, and competitors. It's designed for users interested in understanding their website's global position or exploring the digital footprint of other sites. This GPT can ask clarifying questions for deeper insights and presents analyses in an accurate, clear manner.

## Why Building a GPT to Track Website Global Rankings Matters

In microeconomics, understanding substitutes and complements is essential. For example, as GPTs become more popular, they may either replace or enhance existing services. This trend is evident in my GPT creations:
1. [AbbreviationGPT](https://chat.openai.com/g/g-rtsSizas5-abbreviationgpt): A substitute for abbreviation-focused websites.
2. [AntonymGPT](https://chat.openai.com/g/g-NyfhqK9Ar-antonymgpt) and [Synonym Suggester](https://chat.openai.com/g/g-xC0y77yRg-synonym-suggester): Alternatives to Thesaurus.com.

The core of microeconomics is demand. By identifying common needs, I can develop tools for personal and broader benefit. A key strategy is tracking website global rankings, which reveal prevailing interests and needs. Popular sites like Google, YouTube, TikTok, and various social media platforms exemplify these interests.

On the supply side, I'm creating GPTs to either supplement or replace certain websites. This idea fuels my desire to create a GPT. Its goal is to reveal website global rankings, providing insights into popular preferences and needs.
