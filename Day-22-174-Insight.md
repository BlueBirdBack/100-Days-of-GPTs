(1) except as provided in paragraph (2) no deduction shall be allowed for such expenditures and

(2) the taxpayer shall-

(A) charge such expenditures to capital account and

(B) be allowed an amortization deduction of such expenditures ratably over the 5-year period (15-year period in the case of any specified research or experimental expenditures which are attributable to foreign research (within the meaning of section 41(d)(4)(F))) beginning with the midpoint of the taxable year in which such expenditures are paid or incurred".
