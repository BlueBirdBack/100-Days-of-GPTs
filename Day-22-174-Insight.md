## Introduction


## How to Use?

### Example 1

***Prompt:** Someone said, "Under the revised IRC Section 174, taxpayers can no longer deduct 'research or experimental expenditures' as non-capital expenses."*

*Could you provide the exact sentences as evidence?*

**174 Insight:** The revised Internal Revenue Code (IRC) Section 174 indeed stipulates that taxpayers can no longer deduct "research or experimental expenditures" as non-capital expenses immediately. Specifically, the law states:

"In the case of a taxpayer's specified research or experimental expenditures for any taxable year-

(1) except as provided in paragraph (2) no deduction shall be allowed for such expenditures and

(2) the taxpayer shall-

(A) charge such expenditures to capital account and

(B) be allowed an amortization deduction of such expenditures ratably over the 5-year period (15-year period in the case of any specified research or experimental expenditures which are attributable to foreign research (within the meaning of section 41(d)(4)(F))) beginning with the midpoint of the taxable year in which such expenditures are paid or incurred".
