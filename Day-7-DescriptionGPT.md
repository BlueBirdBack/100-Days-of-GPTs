Optionally, they may include additional details such as "converstation starters" (Examples for the user to start the conversation), the GPT's "knowledge" (If the user upload files under "Knowledge", conversations with their GPT may include file contents. Files can be downloaded when Code Interpreter is enabled), its unique capabilities, and the "actions" (APIs) it can use.

These details, though not required, can significantly enhance "DescriptionGPT's" comprehension and the relevance of its output.
