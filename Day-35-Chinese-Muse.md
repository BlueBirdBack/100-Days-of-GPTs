## 2. Styles

1. Gongbi (工笔): This is a meticulous style that involves detailed brushstrokes that delimit details very precisely. It is often highly colored and usually depicts narrative subjects. It is often practiced by artists working for the royal court or in independent workshops.

2. Xieyi (写意): Also known as freehand or spontaneous style, this technique emphasizes the artist's emotional response to the subject. The brushstrokes are more fluid and less detailed than in gongbi painting. This style is often associated with literati painting, where the expression of personal feelings and the depiction of scenery are more important than the accurate representation of reality.

3. Outline Drawing (白描): Also known as Baimiao or Baimei, this technique involves detailed line drawing with ink, without the use of color, shading, or wash. It requires powerful, confident strokes and is often used for figure painting.

4. Goule (钩勒): This technique involves outlining the subject with fine lines and then filling in the areas with color. It is a method that combines line drawing with color filling.

5. Shuimo (水墨): Also known as ink wash painting, it uses different concentrations of black ink to create a range of shades and textures. This technique is particularly associated with landscape painting.

6. Feibai (飞白): Known as "flying white," this technique involves applying pressure to the brush in a way that causes the hairs to separate, leaving streaks of white space. This effect conveys a sense of speed and vigor, often used to balance the composition and highlight the main subjects.

7. Dry Brush (干笔): In this method, ink is applied with minimal moisture, allowing for a textured, grainy appearance. This technique is effective for depicting the rough surfaces of rocks, tree bark, and other natural elements.

8. Splashed Ink (泼墨): A bold and expressive technique where ink is applied freely, resulting in ink blobs, broad strokes, or saturated areas. This method emphasizes spontaneity and the artist's emotional state.

9. Broken Ink (破墨): This involves varying the ink's density by "breaking" the wash with deeper or lighter tones while the underlying layer is still wet, creating a dynamic and textured effect.

## 3. Coloring Techniques

1. Jinbi (金碧): This technique uses gold and other mineral pigments to create a glittering effect. It was often used in traditional Chinese paintings to depict luxurious and divine scenes.

2. Da xiao qinglü (大小青绿): Refers to the use of various shades of blue and green in painting. "Da qinglü" typically refers to the use of larger areas of these colors, while "xiao qinglü" refers to the use of smaller areas.

3. Meigong (没骨): Translates to "boneless" and refers to a technique where the artist does not use outlines but instead relies on color and shading to define shapes.

4. Pocai (泼彩): A technique where color is applied in a loose and expressive manner, often with splashing or pouring motions.

5. Dancǎi (淡彩): This technique uses light and diluted colors to create a subtle and delicate effect.

6. Qianjiang (浅绛): A style of painting that uses light red or vermilion shades, often in combination with ink wash.

7. Flying White (飞白): Although primarily a method of expression, Feibai also influences the coloring technique by integrating the white of the paper as a color element, enhancing the dynamism and spatial depth of the artwork.

8. Dry Brush (干笔): The Dry Brush technique also affects color application, as the sparse use of ink or pigments results in a unique texture and tonality, contributing to the overall mood and atmosphere of the painting.

9. Splashed Ink (泼墨) and Broken Ink (破墨): These techniques not only serve as expressive methods but also introduce innovative ways to manipulate color and tone, creating vibrant, energetic compositions that break away from traditional color application methods.
