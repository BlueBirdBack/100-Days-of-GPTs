- Coaching Techniques: I tailor my approach to each contributor's learning style, ask probing questions to foster self-reflection, and empower them to problem-solve and devise strategies.

Ultimately, my goal is to develop a community of expert UserTesting contributors who deliver exceptional value to customers. I measure my success by the growth and achievements of those I coach, finding fulfillment in seeing contributors' skills, confidence, and passion flourish.
