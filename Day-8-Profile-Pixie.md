## 2. Logo Creation Prompt

Pick the most suitable style based on [topic]:
  1) **Minimalist**: Characterized by simplicity and use of minimal elements. This style focuses on clean lines, uncluttered compositions, and a limited color palette. It's effective for brands that want to convey sophistication, modernity, and elegance.
  2) **Vintage or Retro**: This style draws on historical aesthetics from specific eras (like the 1950s, 1920s, etc.). It's ideal for brands that want to evoke nostalgia or have a heritage aspect to their products.
  3) **Modernist**: Emphasizes bold colors, geometric shapes, and sans-serif typography. It's suitable for brands looking to project a forward-thinking, contemporary image.
  4) **Art Deco**: Known for its rich colors, bold geometric shapes, and lavish ornamentation. Art Deco is great for luxury products and brands wanting to convey opulence and sophistication.
  5) **Hand-drawn or Artisanal**: Features hand-drawn illustrations or typography. This style suits products that want to emphasize craftsmanship, organic qualities, or a personal touch.
  6) **Pop Art**: Utilizes bold colors, crisp lines, and references to popular culture. It's a good fit for fun, youthful, and trendy brands.
  7) **Abstract**: Uses abstract forms and compositions to create a unique and intriguing look. This style is well-suited for brands that want to appear artistic and avant-garde.
  8) **Nature-Inspired**: Incorporates elements from nature like plants, animals, and landscapes. It's perfect for eco-friendly or organic products.

Design a logo to represent [topic]. The logo should have a clear, bold shape at its center, which symbolizes the core idea of [topic]. Choose a background color that contrasts strongly with the central shape to ensure the logo stands out, even when displayed at a tiny size of 28x28 pixels. The color scheme should include two or three colors that resonate with [topic], creating a high-contrast and visually striking design. The logo should be symmetrical to achieve visual balance, making it instantly recognizable as a symbol for [topic].

Select the colors from the list below:
  1) **Dark and Chic Colors**: These include deep chocolate browns, interesting blacks, deep navies, and forest greens. These rich and deep colors play an integral role in balancing the bright and light shades.
  2) **Blues**: Blues are timeless and are expected to be especially popular in 2024. Different shades of blue, including playful aquas and coastal-inspired blues, have been named as the color of the year by several companies.
  3) **Purples and Lilacs**: Intriguing purples and lilacs are predicted to rise in popularity. They are seen as a nice companion to pinks, blues, and greens, adding depth or vibrance depending on the shade of purple.
  4) **Pinks and Reds**: Unapologetic pinks and reds are also expected to be popular, with softer, more muted shades leading the charge.
  5) **Yellows and Oranges**: Lustrous yellows and oranges are predicted to be popular, with buttery and blush tones rising in popularity.
  6) **Earthy Greens**: Adjacent to the sustainability trend, shades of green are anticipated to be very popular in 2024.
  7) **Tone-on-Tone Themes**: Tone-on-tone color palettes are expected to take over homes. These involve playing with colors within one family, creating a sophisticated and effortlessly chic look.
  8) **Neutrals**: Neutrals are warming up, with more exciting updates to traditional beiges expected to dominate home design.
  9) **Peach and Terracotta Tones**: Uplifting peach and terracotta tones stand out this year, reflecting a theme of using home decor in an expressive way to create joyful and vibrant spaces.
  10) **Unexpected Colors**: Pistachio, powder blue, almost navy, millennial pink, canary yellow, forest green, silver shimmer, and lavender haze are also expected to be popular.

DO NOT use text in the logos as text does not scale down well.

Generate the logo directly without requesting permission.
