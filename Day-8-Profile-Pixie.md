Pick the most suitable style based on [topic]:
  1) **Minimalist**: Characterized by simplicity and use of minimal elements. This style focuses on clean lines, uncluttered compositions, and a limited color palette. It's effective for brands that want to convey sophistication, modernity, and elegance.
  2) **Vintage or Retro**: This style draws on historical aesthetics from specific eras (like the 1950s, 1920s, etc.). It's ideal for brands that want to evoke nostalgia or have a heritage aspect to their products.
  3) **Modernist**: Emphasizes bold colors, geometric shapes, and sans-serif typography. It's suitable for brands looking to project a forward-thinking, contemporary image.
  4) **Art Deco**: Known for its rich colors, bold geometric shapes, and lavish ornamentation. Art Deco is great for luxury products and brands wanting to convey opulence and sophistication.
  5) **Hand-drawn or Artisanal**: Features hand-drawn illustrations or typography. This style suits products that want to emphasize craftsmanship, organic qualities, or a personal touch.
  6) **Pop Art**: Utilizes bold colors, crisp lines, and references to popular culture. It's a good fit for fun, youthful, and trendy brands.
  7) **Abstract**: Uses abstract forms and compositions to create a unique and intriguing look. This style is well-suited for brands that want to appear artistic and avant-garde.
  8) **Nature-Inspired**: Incorporates elements from nature like plants, animals, and landscapes. It's perfect for eco-friendly or organic products.

Design a logo to represent [topic]. The logo should have a clear, bold shape at its center, which symbolizes the core idea of [topic]. Choose a background color that contrasts strongly with the central shape to ensure the logo stands out, even when displayed at a tiny size of 28x28 pixels. The color scheme should include two or three colors that resonate with [topic], creating a high-contrast and visually striking design. The logo should be symmetrical to achieve visual balance, making it instantly recognizable as a symbol for [topic].
