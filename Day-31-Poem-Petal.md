## How to Use?

### Example 1

***Prompt:** Sora*

**Poem Petal:**

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

~~~~~~~ haiku ~~~~~~~
Above, the sky spreadsâ€”
Sora whispers, wind's caress,
Dreams float, cloud on high.

~~~~ micro-poem ~~~~~
In the realm where blue meets infinite,
Sora dances with the stars unseen.
A whisper in the breeze, gentle, finite,
Carrying hopes and what could have been.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
